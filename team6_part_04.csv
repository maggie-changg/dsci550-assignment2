Some have had her vanish on their hoods while others say they have seen her head appear in their vehicles and look at the driver before disappearing. Reports also say if you go down this same length during the day vehicles(which are stopped) may not start up after being shut down. And that she is trying to stop people so that her body may be put to it's ""proper rest"".

Oyster Bay,United States,"The home was originally owned by the Townsend family. The house was used as a base for the British during the Revolutionary War. John Andre was a British Major during the war and visited often. One day Townsend's daughter overheard Andre and John Simcoe (Commander of British Forces) talking about a payment to Benedict Arnold to surrender his troops. The Townsends relayed this information to George Washington. Benedict Arnold escaped, but Andre was captured and hanged. His ghost was first reported here in the 1930s when he was seen on horseback outside a bedroom window. John Andre isn't the only ghost here. Sally Townsend, allegedly John Simcoe's lover is said to still haunt the house. Her former bedroom is always cold, even in the summer the curator wears a warm wool vest in that room! Paranormal investigators have said that whatever is in that room is not happy. In October of 1999 a volunteer was working on the property when the garden door opened and a man came out wearing a dark wool coat with brass buttons. First it was strange to see someone wearing that clothing, second the building was locked, and third the alarms were all on! In march another worker saw the same ghost materialize by the staircase. Once with the bottom half of his body missing, and then again full-figure. The ghost is believed to be Michael Conlin, an Irish immigrant who worked as a servant in the 1860's. In the upstairs of the former servants quarters moving shadows have been seen when no one else is in the house. In that same area the smell of roses has mysteriously been sensed. The spirit of a servant woman has materialized and walked into the kitchen. In that kitchen the smell of apple pie has also been present when ghosts want to make themselves known. The submitter was extremely privileged when they smelled the strong scent of cinnamon-apple on their way down the stairs near the kitchen. When they got down to the bottom of the stairs they could smell the strong scent of something like cinnamon rolls or apple pie! Another area that is said to produce some interesting smells is the front foyer. The smell of a non-existent stove has been sensed there as well as the faint smell of a smoking pipe. At one time this was the kitchen area. The former museum director Andrew Batten says he has sensed at least 5 different entities and something in Sally Townsend's room.",Raynham Hall,New York,NY,-73.5316101,40.8724113,-73.5358541,40.7893778,True,True,0400/03/13,1,Night,Ghost (Male),Suicide,"6,701",23.8,4.18,17.6%,5.4,7.1,1.6,3.7,44.2%,67.2%,63.3%,36.7%,86.4%,2.03%,159338.0,16.33,22.046,3.08,82598.28571428571,820.7857142857143,395281.0,128.0,125.0,Much Above Average,1029.0,494.0,256.0,27.0,68.0,79.0,105.0

Poughkeepsie,United States,"The ghost of former Rector, Dr. Alexander Griswold Cummings has been reported here many times since his death in the late 1940s or early 50s. While he was still living, he did not like using candles, so candles used during services were repeatedly blown out. At one point, a bat materialized in the church, then disappeared. In the 1970s, Bishop James Pike, Rector at the time, scared the ghost away from the sanctuary by bringing his dog into the church. After that, Alexander remained quiet for a while. In the 1990s, Alexander surfaced again. This time, it was because current Rector, the Rev. Michael Phillips, decided to move the Rector's office to a different location in the building. The move outraged the ghost, and for years afterwards, the old rector's office (now the library) would be freezing cold in the mornings, even during the spring. Eventually, the ghost went back into hiding. Another ghost is the spirit of an elderly lady, who died in the middle of a service sometime in the 1910s.

Merrill,United States,"In the 1850's white lumbermen were welcomed by the Indians and their chief. Some time later his daughter Jenny, for whom the settlement was named for died. On how she died is speculation. One account says she fell in love with one of the lumberman, became pregnant and killed herself. Another is, she died during child birth. Another is she died from flu brought by the white man. The chief buried her on the hill, and cursed the ground that it would never do any white man any good. The curse is the legend. Nine people died after T.B. Scott bought the land for a home in 1884 and died unexpectedly in 1886 before the house was finished. Within a year his wife Ann died. Their son Walter went to see the architect to finish the house. He was stabbed to death by him. In 1893 it was sold to a man named Kuechle. He lost all his money on a gold mine and mortgaged the house to Tony Barsanti. Tony foreclosed and Kuechle went insane and died in an asylum. The same year Barsanti was stabbed to death in Chicago while waiting for a train to Merrill. In 1901, George Gibson bought the house and went to inspect it. He was never seen again. In 1906, Mary Fellhaber bought the property. Soon after fell ill and died. Popcorn Dan was the caretaker and died in 1912 after booking passage on the Titanic.The next caretaker Mr. Lloydsen died of alcoholism. In 1919 the widower of M. Fellhaber gave the property to the city. In 1923 the city gave it to the Sisters of the Holy Cross who have seemed to break the curse for now.

Westchester,United States,"On the border of White Plains, NY and possibly New Castle, NY, there is a road tucked away in the woods. Buckhout road evidently dates way back to the early days of the country, 1600's. the local magistrate or some such, (an influential person in the area nonetheless) by the name of Isaac Buckhout suspected that his wife was cheating on him with a friend of his. He invited the friend and his son over to dinner one night where he proceeded to take a shotgun and kill the two of them as well as his wife. Afterward he walked a good 12-15 miles to Tarrytown and sat in a pub until the police picked him up a few hours later. The jury that tried him deliberated for days over his sentence but as the story goes he was the last man hung in White Plains, NY. Now apparently off the main road there are several side roads wherein if you walk into the woods you will see houses that have been abandoned. Further legend has it that back in the 1600's three women were burned at the stake supposedly for witchcraft where the road now lies. There have been reports of their spirits supposedly roaming the area around the road and rumors tell a story of three X's being painted on the road to mark the spot where the woman died. As legend goes, if you drive over these X's and stop, your car will stall and ""strange things will happen."" Exactly what is not known.

Another story is that two children who lived in the nearby mansion were playing in the road when they were run over and killed. When your car moves, it is the children pushing it off of them.

Mount Ayr,United States,"Tedrow is a small cemetery in the country. In the daytime, there is a tree that contains an evil face. But at night, the spirits frequently make themselves known. It is not the cemetery but it is the woods that surrounds the cemetery that is haunted. Apparently about fifty to a hundred years ago, a small cult came the cemetery and did ceremonies. Now whenever you drive at night into the cemetery, you may enter but you may not be able to get out. The reason for this is because there is a glowing object in the woods and if this glowing object gets too close to you, you will not be able to start your car. But in order to witness the strange happenings you need to have your car turned off and lights turned off. You can have a flashlight with you but that is it. While you are in complete silence and complete darkness, something might run passed you several times and when you look nothing will be there. Sometimes you might hear moaning in the woods, sometimes you will hear what sounds like somebody pounding a metal sheet against a tree. Sometimes you will see a dark figure staring at you from a tree. And if you are really lucky, you will witness the strangest and scariest experience that you ever had. At times you might wait for a good five or ten minutes and nothing will seem to happen, but when you have given up all hope and decide to leave, all at once there will sound like a herd of elephants are all around you and make the loudest racket. You are guaranteed to jump in your car and take off, but that is just the beginning. If you leave your window open, while your driving, you will hear the object following you until you have reached the end of the pathway leading to the cemetery. Also the weather is completely different there, it could be a hot day and when you reach the cemetery, it will be cold. And it could be the clearest day and when you reach the cemetery it will begin to rain. And there could be no wind at all and when you reach the cemetery there will be ten to twenty mile an hour winds. - Fair WARNING ?

Stratford,United States,"In the middle of three miles of woods, is a cemetery that is over 150 years old. It was once the ancient burial ground of the local Indian tribe.

Charleston,United States,"This theatre was built in 1909 on the site of the old Welch Mansion that had stood there since 1798.

The former theatre where ""Mountain Stage"" was recorded, is a place that gives people chills when they enter the area. The most prolific ghost here is that of John Welch.

Charleston,United States,"On the bank of the Kanawaha River, at the train depot, just at the bottom of the exclusive South Hills mountain drive, the Charleston Train Depot rivals any 19th century European Town Center. At the depot, flanked by the river on one side and a winding suburban mountain road also exists a carriage trail which led, in days gone by, to the Governors Mansion. The depot has a restaurant and a scenic view. The old carriage trail is barely noticeable from the train platform, but driving up the hill on the right side of the forked road motorists can see a clear wide carriage road leading to what is now Sunrise Museum. Vagrants and homeless people are said to spend some nights near the bottom of the trail waiting for a train to hop, and high school students sometimes wander the trail at the top of the trail behind the museum. No one ventures past the desecrated statue of a Our Lady. A dark spot exists in summer and winter at the second curve from the top of the trail (or the third from the bottom).

Parkersburg,United States,"One mile south of Parkersburg, is a small farming community called Marrtown that was settled by Scottish Immigrants in the mid 1800s. They came from an area of Scotland that believed in many supernatural creatures, including witches, ghosts, elves, fairies and not the least of them, the Banshee. The Banshee is an Irish/Scottish death fairy who attaches herself to Scottish and Irish clans. She sometimes rides a white horse and hangs out at waterways washing out the grave clothes of her dead. She is dressed in a death shroud and other tattered rag and her eyes are blood red from crying for her Scottish dead. Thomas and Mary Marr survived the Civil War, but they lost a lot of property. Thomas went to work on the toll bridge in Parkersburg that went over the little Kanawha River. He would always see a figure on a white horse whenever he came home very early in the morning. On February 5th, 1873, Mary awakened with a feeling of dread. She got up and look out the window and saw someone very old riding a white horse who was coming up to her front stoop. She went outside and saw it was an old woman whose eyes had an eerie glow. Finally, the old woman screamed, ""Mary Marr, Thomas Marr has just died. Say your prayers, Lady. I bid you will."" Woman and horse instantly disappeared. Within the hour, a man who worked with Thomas came to deliver the dreaded news. In fact, Thomas Marr did die -- he died in the icy waters of the little Kanawha River. Some say it was an assailants bullet that brought him down, Others say it was the keening cry of his Scottish Banshee that wailed and startled him into falling and meeting his death in the river below. Many still claim the Scottish Banshee still rides her horse on clear night and she still brings death to those of Irish or Scottish blood. Even to this day, the Marr family is still visited by the Banshee's presence. It would be wise to stay away from Marrtown on cold, lonely, moonless nights.",Marrtown,West Virginia,WV,-81.5852649,39.2546161,-81.56151349999999,39.2667418,True,True,1873/01/01,1,Morning,Ghost (Male),Accident,"1,037",27.3,7.24,13.9%,6.4,9.8,1.8,5.1,39.1%,70.8%,49.8%,50.2%,84.0%,2.03%,28285.0,1.335,1.802,2.97,5208.642857142857,69.07142857142857,43340.78571428572,129.0,92.0,Below Average,,,,,,,

Nurses will tell you that they will hear the sound of a baby crying a day before a baby will be delivered.

Curlew,United States,"Curlew/Cascade Job corps. - a former student of Curlew Job corps has heard many of the same stories; how ever, they are set there on the Curlew campus. The tunnel story for the Curlew campus is very likely true, for that campus was a S.A.C. radar compound before the corps took it over. The Dish is still up on top of the hill lovingly referred to as ""Radar hill"". Cascade however, has always been a Job corps campus. Curlew is definitely haunted. Colville Native American Elders believe that the site where the Curlew campus is in the heart of sacred land. Normally sacred land reacts badly to being tampered with, but the Job corps is a place where children go to heal troubled hearts, pasts, and souls. This campus has a 98% success rate because the spirits there are helping where the staff cannot. - July 2005 Update/ Correction - Cascade Job Corps is housed in what was originally Northern State Hospital for the Insane. The Hospital opened for business in 1912 and remained an insane asylum until I believe right around 1970. Locally it is referred to simply as Northern State Mental Hospital.

Duvall / Maltby,United States,"It is hidden off to the right hand side of the Redmond Duval Road. (20 miles East of Seattle.) It has about 35 grave sights and strange, unexplained things happen there. People have seen women and children, dressed in old, raggedy looking close, wondering around the gravesites. Witnesses have also felt physical things like being hit.February 2005 additional information: There used to be a staircase that began at ground level and descended 13 steps below ground. I believe the legend/story was that it was a below-grade entrance to the opulent tomb of a locally wealthy family. In any case, kids used to get drunk near or in the cemetery and would walk down these steps late at night. It is unsure whether there were doors or simply a dirt wall at the bottom of these steps. Regardless, once you reached the bottom of the stairs and turned around you supposedly no longer saw the cemetery but a vision of Hell. The similarity in this story to yours is that this vision drove the subject to insanity. Anyone watching the subject walk down the stairs witnessed them stop, turn, and fall dumbfounded to their knees. I’ve heard that several children emerged nearly comatose from the steps – many of them never uttered another word. the story goes that these steps were bulldozed over (depending on the age of the storyteller, the bulldozing occurred anywhere from 1992 to the early 1960’s) and that the severe NO TRESPASSING limitations were a result of that.

Chesterton,United States,"Around 1915, the area that is now the Dunes State Park in northern Indiana was mostly uninhabited wilderness. The stories spread around the vicinity of Chesterton, Indiana that fishermen who were along the beach at certain times of the day had been lucky enough to catch a glimpse of a naked woman swimming in the lake. The story spread that a beautiful woman was living as a hermit along the beach and her notoriety grew to a point that many compared her to the ancient Greek goddess Diana...hence the name of this legendary creature. In truth, her name was Alice Marble Gray and she was the daughter of an influential couple from Chicago. Alice had traveled extensively and was cultured and educated. She had worked in the city as an editorial secretary for a popular magazine, so what had made her take up the lonely life of a recluse. Some have claimed that Alice came to the dunes because of a broken love affair but actually she left the city life because her deteriorating eyesight had made her work impossible. She had sought refuge in the rough land that she had enjoyed as a child. Alice moved into an abandoned fisherman's cottage on the beach and lived a life of peace, borrowing books from the library, walking in the woods and of course, swimming naked in the chilly waters of Lake Michigan. In 1920, Alice met a drifter named Paul Wilson and he moved into the cabin with her. He was an unemployed boat builder with a shaky past but he seemed to make Alice happy and the two of them stayed together until 1922.... when tragedy struck. The badly burned and beaten body of a man was found on the beach and police suspected that Wilson had a hand in the murder. He was questioned but eventually let go. He and Alice moved to nearby Michigan City, Indiana, where they made a small living selling handmade furniture. Alice bore her husband two daughters but he treated her terribly, often beating her severely. In 1925, Alice died in her home, shortly after the birth of her second daughter. The official cause of death was said to be uremia poisoning...complicated by repeated blows to her back and stomach. Wilson disappeared and later tuned up in a California prison, serving time for auto theft. The fate of Alice's daughters is unknown. Legends of the dunes say that Alice still returns to the beach and the wilderness that she loved so much.

Elgin,United States,"The resturant employees have claimed of seeing orbs of light and feeling cold spots, as well as the lights and ovens turning on and off in many different occasions.

There have been stories of a young teenage boy having been shot and killed in front of the resturant, in the 1980's sometime. It is said that it is his angry and depressed spirt that plagues this location with the paranormal. - August, 2005 Update: Beef Villa (half Fact) The original Beef Villa that was involved in a murder in the 1980s has been torn down. Another Beef Villa has been built in its place that is much bigger so that it can handle more customers. The new building is further back in the lot than the old one. Where the old one existed is now parking. No activity has been reported seen since the new building was up.- January 2006 Update: Well known urban legend started by students at the local High School across the street in order to scare the freshmen. What was uncovered was no death had occurred, there was a gang shooting in the 1980s the victim survived. We checked everything including police reports to verify this. There is an awkward magnetic field in the area which has explained the orbs as the buildings around the Beef Villa and even the Beef Villa were torn down and rebuilt and the road it is on is under construction once a year as it as a main road that attaches to the local highway.WARNING:If there is anyone that is planning on doing anything in any of those locations they must be sure that they have permission first else they will be arrested.",Beef Villa,Illinois,IL,-88.2678985,42.0561803,-88.2825668,42.0354084,False,True,2005/08/13,6,Unknown,"Orb (Male, student)",Murder,"5,151",26.2,5.17,20.5%,5.7,9.1,1.9,4.4,52.0%,70.6%,57.4%,42.6%,82.0%,3.48%,134820.0,9.716,13.116,2.51,64291.92857142857,796.0714285714286,368952.9285714286,127.0,121.0,Above Average,122.0,52.0,25.0,13.0,5.0,15.0,13.0
Elgin,United States,"Everything from cold spots, to apparitions, to footsteps from the upper floor (when you are ""alone"" in the building)has been reported here. When an addition was built on to the building, over 13 skeletons were found in the ground under which the school was built. Most of them estimated to be children ages ranging 10 to 17 years of age. if you enter this building after dark, be prepared to hear voices whispering in your ear, as well as screaming from the upper floor(it all seems to be centered around the upper floor)doors that open and close by themselves, and an elevator that operates itself! Many night custodians have fled Phe building in the middle of their shift, leaving personal belongings, scared to death, refusing to tell what they saw, or heard. And refusing to ever enter the building again.- August, 2005 Update/Additional information: There are 3 common grave stones that can be easily seen and at this time most stones have now been removed from the hill. The Cemetery was mostly children but the ages were between stillborn and 10 with some adult graves. The best-known grave that is still intact was from an old man that worked at the Elgin Watch factory in the early 1900s. The school itself was founded and built over the cemetery in 1968.- January 2006 Update: Graves still exist here. The Local School District U46 that owns the school had in the past removed only a few graves(Just enough to build a basement) and left everything else. In the 1990s they dug up a total of 8 skeletons in the area where they were going to expand the building. They also at the same time finally removed stones from the hill, though it is unlikely that they bodies were moved with as no digging took place for that assignment but there is fresh sod on the hill. Another fact is that the majority of the graves were not children but adults. One of the few remaining graves being of a man that was older but worked at the Elgin Watch Factory in the Early years of the town. There is another fact. When the school was first built in 1968 a house on its boundary took many of the stones from the site and used them in the foundation of the house that was being built. This is a true haunted site.

Elgin,United States,"Elgin State was a relic of the 1950s era of using pain for mental treatment. Electroshock and cold therapy were some of the ghastly methods used on patients. Many died and as the years went on, and the cemetery ran out of room, the bodies were incinerated in the basement. The campus is shut down, and is closed down. Visitors have to hop a fence and run from the security guards to avoid being fined $5,000. Reports include tapings, screams, shadows, lights inside, cold fields, and fog. Inside, visitors claim to see blood stained walls, and smell the scent of decay.

Elgin,United States,"The school was about 100 years old. People have said that they hear little children crying or laughing by the k.g. area. Down in the basement people said that they hear noise of someone hamming some type of metal. Teachers seem to stick together when going to their class room. During night time people have said that weird things happen in the building. Few years back the school had a vote to build a new school or to remodel the old building, students and staff voted for a new school. The school no longer stands and place where it once stood is now a parking lot for the new school. - August, 2005 Update: This is a popular Urban Legend Hoax. This school was originally built in the 1940s therefore it is not anywhere near 100 years old. The old building was torn down due to asbestos and a need for a larger building, as the place was tiny but built in a way that they could not expand upon. They rebuilt it so that it was on a different part of the hill that it was on and now more capable of expansion. This was done back in 2000. The building was recently closed after being open for one year due to the fact the district did not have the funding to keep it open as the Person who was superintendent for the last several Years a Dr. Marvin Edwards retired shortly after playing with the accountants books and it was determined that when he left he took several million dollars with him. Thus the district has had to close down many of its schools to save money. Among the schools were Illinois park and Grant Elementary which was one of the oldest elementary schools in the area being that it was Grant that was the 100-year-old school. Thus the whole thing about Illinois park is not fact.- January 2006 Update: Illinois park just so happens to have been built in 1930s. The original building was torn down as they needed to fit more students in the building than there was room for. The newer building was built in 1999. This building is abandoned at the moment due to lack of funding by school District U46 to keep it open. basement in the old building was a large open area used only as storage. The only people that could go back and forth in the basement were the janitors. Though the building is abandoned it is on land owned by the district and the Elgin Police department is constantly on the premises.

Elmhurst,United States,"At one time it was also called Spaso Speakeasy, originally it was a lovely stone manor. Directions to follow the story, It is said that long ago the woman that owned it hung herself in the attic/which has been converted to the office/storage space for whatever business inhabits the building. The small basement has been used as a liquor/storage room. The building has several dining areas with fireplaces in each one that have been converted to gas. Employees of then Spaso Speakeasy were almost asphyxiated by gas fumes when setting up before opening one day, everybody began to get sick, it was later discovered that the gas for the fireplaces had been turned on but not lit. For years employees have complained that the pull chain light switch at the top of the basement stairs, gets pulled and the light goes out, forcing you to either try maneuvering the stairs in the dark or leave the lower light on, if you walk up the stairs and turn it on and go back down to finish what you are doing, the light chain gets pulled, and the light goes out. There are secret panels and rooms behind the walls, that very few people are aware of, their purpose is unknown at this time. One in particular is between the front entranceway and the kitchen, along the wall to the left. The bar area is particularly active, and things disappear and reappear, such as a corkscrew that disappeared. After exhaustive searching, the manager went out and purchased another one, a few hours later, the missing corkscrew was simply sitting out in plain sight on the bar, in the open. The ghost has been called Mrs. Murphy, although, it is not known if that was/is the true name, and is more like a trickster than a specter. Just an odd note, a Halloween party was held in the year 1989, (then Spaso Speakeasy) a raffle was given for door prizes and the first ticket drawn was *0666, No one held that ticket and it was not in sequence with the role of tickets being used. Most/all businesses in this building have failed, it is/was near the corner of North Avenue and Route 83, If you start out at the intersection of North and York, travel toward Route 83, it is on the right side, one business from the corner, a Peppers Waterbed Store used to be the business just past it. It is within visual distance of the Golden Pheasant restaurant, which is across 83, and on the left. -  December 2005 correction/Update: The Stone Cottage Pizza building in Elmhurst is still there. It had been converted to a relatively popular bar and grill. That business, on westbound North Ave. has failed. There is a sign on it saying, ""scheduled for commercial redevelopment"". Parking availability cannot be blamed for it's closing. The Golden Pheasant restaurant mentioned in the same spot on the eastbound side of North Ave. still flourishes with the same amount of space. North Ave and Route 83, is reported to be the busiest intersection in the state. - March 2007 Update: It is being torn down with two next door establishments and will probably be use for mini-strip mall or something like that. - October 2007 Update: It has been demolished.",The old Stone Cottage Pizzeria,Illinois,IL,,,-87.9403418,41.8994744,False,False,1989/03/13,6,Night,Ghost (Male),Accident,"5,151",26.2,5.17,20.5%,5.7,9.1,1.9,4.4,52.0%,70.6%,57.4%,42.6%,82.0%,3.48%,134820.0,9.716,13.116,2.51,64291.92857142857,796.0714285714286,368952.9285714286,127.0,121.0,Above Average,122.0,52.0,25.0,13.0,5.0,15.0,13.0

Slavery was Illegal in IL, so the owner has a side entrance built on to the house that a wagon could pull up to and a person or persons could be taken into the house and up to attic without being seen.

Evergreen Park,United States,"Evergreen Cemetery, 87th St.& Kedzie Ave., A young girl, 12 to 14 years of age, is said to haunt one of the CTA bus stops along 87th St. It is said that she will board a bus, at night, and go immediately go to the back of the bus, without paying the fare. When the driver turns around to tell her to pay, the bus is empty. Some drivers of cars on 87th St. have reported seeing ""heads"" floating above gravestones,( or late night ""visitors"" peeking from behind?) and people sitting on some of the stone benches in cemetery at night. As this cemetery has no fence a more mundane explanation could fit. The Writer has seen vehicles drive right off of Kedzie, over the curb, and into the cemetery at night.

Evergreen Park,United States,"St. Mary's Cemetery, The boundaries of this cemetery are, The B & O railroad tracks which cross 87th St. on the east side, Pulaski Rd. on the west, 87th St. on the north, and 91st St. on the south. Unlike Evergreen Cemetery to the east, St. Mary's has a fence going completely around it, with the main gate on 87th St. and a smaller gate on 91st St. located between Homan and Trumbull Avenues. Late night drivers on 91st St. have reported seeing someone leaning against a fence post along the fence bordering the railroad tracks, with his arms folding across his chest. One driver reported that the figure seemed to react to his driving by, by placing his hands on his knees and crouching down, as if to look at him from under the branches of the tree between them, after which the figure disappeared. That St. Mary's has not had more reports is somewhat surprising, as several deaths, all violent, have happened in and around the cemetery over the years. The first death was in 1927 at a restaurant/speakeasy located along the tracks, at that time many funerals came to the cemetery by train, where the party would have the funeral, then have the after funeral lunch at the restaurant while waiting for the return train. During Prohibition, this restaurant( known as ""Vinegar Hill"") was used as a speakeasy after dark, in 1927 one of the Westside O'Bannion Brothers was murdered there, by the Capone Mob. The next death happened in 1933, on the tracks, about 30 yards south of 91st. At this spot occurred the last daylight Train Robbery in the U.S. Two men stopped the train at this point and stole $50,000. from the mail car. One of the robbers was killed during the robbery and never identified, the other robber was never caught, and the money never recovered. Finally, in the 1990's two men where shot once each in the heart, around 2:00a.m. While ""visiting"" the grave of a rival street gang member, on the anniversary of his death, this murder is unsolved. Trespassing is not only not allowed, but unnecessary, as the only reports of ghostly activity have all been observed from outside the cemeteries, (Evergreen Cemetery, and St. Mary's).",St. Mary's Cemetery,Illinois,IL,-87.71649049999999,41.7318414,-87.7017175,41.7205889,True,True,2025/05/13,1,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"5,151",26.2,5.17,20.5%,5.7,9.1,1.9,4.4,52.0%,70.6%,57.4%,42.6%,82.0%,3.48%,134820.0,9.716,13.116,2.51,64291.92857142857,796.0714285714286,368952.9285714286,127.0,121.0,Above Average,122.0,52.0,25.0,13.0,5.0,15.0,13.0

Indianapolis,United States,"haunted by the young wife of the first owner. When you go by the house at night you can see blue lights flickering on and off on the grounds and in the tower window. According to legend the man couldn't stand the thought of burying his lovely young wife so had a special glass coffin built and placed in the tower. He would go visit his wife every night. The tower was lit by soft blue lights, her favorite color. - June 2008 Correction / Additional information: It was located on Fall Creek Road and is now Skiles Test Park. The house was abandoned and torn down in the 1980's. It also says that the owner had placed his deceased wife into a glass coffin and displayed her in a tower. This part of the story is also incorrect. The story goes that Mr. Skiles Test, after the unexpected death of his wife, had her placed in a glass coffin and displayed in a large bay window of his home surrounded by blue lights. Now that Mr. Test has passed away and the house has been torn down, at night you can still see the glow of the blue lights. The story of the house of blue lights is not true but it is a story that I would like to pass down to my children. The reason that Mr. Tests home was called the house of blue lights is because he loved the color so much that he kept his Christmas lights up on his house and around his pool year round. Mr. Test was a very wealthy business man that was committed to his community and even donated a parcel of his land to the Lawrence Township School Board. The school board graciously accepted the land and built an elementary school on it named after Mr. Test.

She went to see what was going on and they both told her that there was a man at the top of the stairs (the stairs that led to the balcony). The woman called one of the workers in and he asked the kids what the man looked like. They gave him a very elaborate description. A few days later that same worker was closing up after the shows and was making sure the emergency exits were closed. As he walked out of the hallway to the one exit he looked up to the projection room and saw a man duck his head really quickly. The man fit the same description the 3 and 5 year old children gave just days before. He ran immediately upstairs; the only way to get to the projection room and there was noone to be found. About a week later a man came along and bought The Strand and the worker noticed this man looked very familiar. He talked to the man and found out that the man's father used to own The Strand as well and killed himself in the projection room years before.

Also, reported are an elderly woman, believed to be someone who died from a terminal illness in the house; a former nanny and her charge, a young boy; and other spirits not identified. Many, many sightings of spirits and other strange events have occurred at the residence and have been witnessed by occupants, visitors, the psychics and reporter and others such as gas meter readers, etc. A boy who lived there experienced repeated visits from the ghostly nanny and boy who repeatedly invited him to join the ghost boy forever as his playmate.

The main telephone: all the lights would light up all of a sudden for a few seconds then shut off. This happened several times but there was nothing wrong with the phone itself. They used to hear whistling periodically, toward the end of their shift. They would go see who it was and there was never anybody around. The manager's apartment was off of the front desk area. At the time, the manager did not reside there, so it was empty. One night, the front desk phone rang. The ring was different so the clerk knew it was coming from a guest room. When they looked to see what room, It was coming from the manager's apartment! No one was on the line.

People who claimed to give her a ride back to her house get as far as Ross cemetery before she disappears. The same cemetery that she was buried in 1955. More history to this road is during heavy mafia activity in Chicago around the 1930's they would dump bodies off this road because it was, at the time, out of the way and seldom traveled. Most of the bodies were not discovered until the mid sixties when the area started to be developed. Through the late 1980's until the mid 1990's the woods around this road became a popular place to commit suicide. Most people that have killed themselves there were area high school students. There are a few houses still on the road, near the main development. Many reports of various apparitions (figures in the woods, ghostly lights, voices, being chased by cars/ creatures). also, mostly due to the fact that it is surrounded by woods, various animal parts are frequently found along the road. these are odd in the fact that they seem to almost always be placed in the exact center of the road. Never an entire animal like road kill, but parts...a head, a leg, a torso. Usually rabbits or raccoons but household pets have also been reported, One person witnessed the head of a large dog, a German shepherd or similar large breed, positioned in the center of the road. There was no blood and the eyes were open staring down the line of the road.",Reeder Road,Indiana,IN,,,-87.33281389999999,41.4828144,True,True,1955/03/13,8,Night,"Ghost (Male, student)",Murder,"2,960",27.0,5.69,17.1%,5.6,9.1,1.7,4.2,49.7%,70.5%,55.3%,44.7%,81.8%,3.41%,79925.0,4.468,6.032,2.65,21759.85714285714,335.57142857142856,204857.64285714287,125.0,103.0,Near Average,344.0,100.0,44.0,90.0,27.0,70.0,14.0

If you are coming from Lafayette, go right on it. You will come to a stop sign. Go thru the sign. That is Hamilton road. There are 3 one-lane bridges on this road, when you get to the third bridge, stop and flash your lights 4 times. As you then cross the bridge, you will see a short man in your rearview mirror chasing you. If you drive up the road about 50 feet you will come to an old church graveyard. Go it the graveyard and park as close to the back as you can get. Walk along the fence and you will see what looks like flames coming from the woods. This is where the church once stood. It is said that when it caught fire in the 1800s that everyone was killed. Also there are old haunted tracks right after the graveyard. Go about midnight and stop in the middle of the tracks. Put baby powder on your rear bumper. You will hear a train whistle and see the lights come at you. Then they will disappear. Get out and look at the back of your car and you will see baby fingerprints. A little boy named Danny was killed here in the early 1900s right after the tracks were built.

Muncie,United States,"A family moved into the possible haunted home on West 6th Street in Muncie after the landlord lowered the rent. He explained to the family that previous tenants didn't want to stay longer than 2 months. After the family had lived there for a while, the children were scared of the upstairs playroom because of the old lady that lived there. The old lady that the kids were seeing was a ghost. Later unexplained happenings were pacing sounds in the playroom, kids tucked into bed, and items in the kitchen, such as mayonnaise being moved. A boy had died in the bedroom and his mother died there years afterwards. I have also heard about weird occurrences like past tenants waking up and having some sort of oil dumped on them.

Ottawa,United States,"Located in Spring Falls off of route 6. The story goes: There was an old biker bar on route 6 in the 1980's and a man and his wife were drunk but decided to go home. He also decided to take the short cut, a small road with deep ditches on each side, not many people took this road back then because of it's size. Anyways there was a curve in the road and the man was going really fast and slung shot him and his wife into the ditch, on impact the wife died and the man was paralyzed from the waist down and was bleeding everywhere, knowing no one could see him in the ditch he went up onto the road and wrote HELP in big letters across the road in his blood. He then went back down to his wife and died later around 3:00. Around 9:00 in the morning a farmer was going down the same road, because this was his normal route and he known the road well. Saw the help on the road and thought that it was some teenagers playing a trick, then seeing the man and woman next to the motorcycle wreck drove to town to the sheriff’s office and told him of what he saw. After the sheriff and his team took the motorcycle and bodies out of the ditch and to the town they had to wash off the HELP in blood with chemicals so no one would become freaked out. the next morning the farmer was going down the road again and saw the HELP as clear as day and was appalled that they didn't wash it off. he went to the sheriff and told him to clean it. Confused the sheriff sent the team out again to clean it, this time the farmer watched, the next morning the farmer again went down the road and saw the HELP spooked, and knowing that it had in fact been cleaned he told the sheriff and they thought that it must have been some kids. So the night-shift sheriff went on his routes throughout the town and also took help road to see if he could catch the kids playing the trick. He went down to the spot around 2:00 am and there weren't any words or people around. Around 3:05 he came back the there were the words HELP in blood. In the same exact writing as it had been the first day. Since then help road has been widen a little and paved over and every time the words HELP appear in the same spot in the same exact way.
