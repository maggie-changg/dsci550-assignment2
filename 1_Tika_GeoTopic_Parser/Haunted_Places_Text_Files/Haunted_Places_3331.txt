Location: Discoveryland! Theater

Description:
The shows at Discoveryland! take place in an outdoor theater and live horses are a part of the show. One evening while driving a one-horse cart up hill after leaving the stage I felt someone shove the carriage from behind. No one was there. Another wrangler reported having felt someone enter the cart she driving in the same place a few weeks earlier.
