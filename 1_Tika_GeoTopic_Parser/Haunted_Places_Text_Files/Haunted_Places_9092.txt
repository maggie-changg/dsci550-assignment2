Location: Old Greenhouse Road

Description:
The ghost of an old woman who died in a car wreck appears here. If you turn off your headlights and drive around the corner to the bridge VERY slowly, a mist forms over the bridge and comes together to form the shape of a person. They say if you stick around long enough, the apparition will begin to approach the car. My friends and I have seen this ghost appear on even the clearest of nights. The ghost seems to prefer warm or cold clear nights or nights just after it has rained..
