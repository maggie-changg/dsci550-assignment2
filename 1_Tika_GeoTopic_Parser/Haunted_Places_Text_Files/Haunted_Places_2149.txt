Location: Lithia Park

Description:
Story of a ghost of a girl who was raped and murdered there in the late 1800's. As witnesses passed a duck pond, they noticed a glowing blue mist floating directly over the center of the pond. They watched it for about thirty seconds, at which point it flickered and vanished like a flame being blown out.
