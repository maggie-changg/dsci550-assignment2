Location: Wentworth Military Academy

Description:
Groendyke Hall - The basement of Groendyke Hall is off-limits, and many of the rooms down there are boarded up. - April 2007 Additional information - the basement had a cadet dressed in spats, and was said to walk up and down the old JROTC hall without making noises. I was at the top of the building one night when 3 cadets came bolting up the stairs pale, and scared. They all spoke at once, and told me that they saw a “old style” cadet walking toward them, and they could see right through him.
