Location: Louisburg College

Description:
Well here at Louisburg we have many old buildings. The school was founded in 1787 and the Main Building served as a hospital during the Civil War. Students have heard doors slam and no one would be there. There have been sightings of a little boy with no face walking around campus at night, hear voices and sounds and when they looked there was no one there. Not to mention the suicides. A woman hung herself in one of the dorms, and another lady was killed in another building.
