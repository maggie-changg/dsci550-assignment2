Location: The Batavia Inn

Description:
Bed and Breakfast - reports of visitors feeling a ghost running it's fingers through her hair and it would get freezing cold until she could see her breathe. This was sometime in the summer. She yelled out, "There's a ghost in here and I know it and I'm going to take your picture!" She took a picture and she roports right where the cold spot was and it was a large black spot that looked like it had hundreds of screaming faces in it.
