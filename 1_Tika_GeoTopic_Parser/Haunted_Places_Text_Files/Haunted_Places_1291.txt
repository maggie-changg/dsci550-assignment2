Description:
old TB sanitarium - Cemetery -  Two residents went to the old cemetery on the hill late at night to 'ghost hunt' and reported feeling someone touch them and the man had his cap pulled off his head several times, another time when they went there they heard voices in the cemetery when no one was there but they could not locate where the voices were coming from.
