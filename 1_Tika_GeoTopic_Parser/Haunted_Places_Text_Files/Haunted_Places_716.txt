Location: Gettysburg College

Description:
Pennsylvania Hall - The Administrative offices on the campus are housed in a large, white building (Penn Hall) that was a hospital during the civil war. Several faculty members and students have seen a very graphic and horrible civil war hospital scene when the elevator in the building mysteriously goes out of control and takes the passengers to the basement. When the doors open, they are faced with the ghostly scene instead of the usual storage facility that is in the basement. The cupola on top of the building is also said to be haunted. Several students and faculty walking across campus late at night have seen a civil war soldier standing guard on top of the cupola. In several instances the soldier will spot the person and take aim with his rifle.
