Location: The Travel Lodge Motel

Description:
Three connected rooms in this motel are haunted. In one of the rooms the light in the bathroom will flicker on and off throughout the night (the switch is sideways, making a loud clicking noise). In another room a specter plays with the visitors belongings. It likes to use their credit cards, money, and driver's license to play a game of poker under the bed. In the last room during the hours of 12 and 2:30 a foul smell is present in the room, which is said to be the same spirit that likes to play with the lights and belongings. There was also a case where a mysterious man wearing all green and a cap that concealed all of his face except for his red beard. He was working in the office in the early morning hours; the next day it was discovered that no men were employed at this motel, yet he had a set of keys and checked in customers. There were no other employees at the establishment at the time.
