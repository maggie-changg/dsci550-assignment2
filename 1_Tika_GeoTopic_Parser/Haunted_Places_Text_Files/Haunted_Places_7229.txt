Location: Rockford College

Description:
The Clark Arts Center -  is said to be haunted by the ghost of the Theatre Arts professor who designed the building. Flickering lights, piano music, and echoing footsteps on catwalks are just some instances of this; in particular, Cheek Theater, Maddox Theater (as well as the hallway outside of it) and the green room (actors' dressing room) seem to be hot spots.
