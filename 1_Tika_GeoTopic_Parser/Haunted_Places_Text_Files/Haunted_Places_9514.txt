Location: The University of Florida

Description:
Thomas Hall Dormitory - with its red brick surface and gothic gargoyles at the entrances, is one of the oldest buildings on campus, dating back to the early 1900s. The building used to be used for classrooms and residents have been known to hear ceaseless banging coming from the radiators/heaters during the months when they aren't in use. The presence of an old employee is thought to haunt the building.
