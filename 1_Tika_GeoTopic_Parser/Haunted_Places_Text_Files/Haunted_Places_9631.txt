Location: Super 8 Motel

Description:
Room 206 - I-drive - room 206 is haunted by the ghost of a man who rises from bed also bed shakes, and feels like someone is getting in bed beside you when no one is there. The room stays cold and it feels as if youâ€™re being watched. The sink also comes on by itself.
