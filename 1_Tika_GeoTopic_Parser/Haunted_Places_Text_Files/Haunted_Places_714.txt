Location: Gettysburg College

Description:
Brua Hall - The theater on campus, Brua Hall, is said to be haunted by a civil war era man. He frequently visits the theater at night and has been seen backstage and on the catwalk of the theater. He likes to play practical jokes and move props and costumes around. The man has a favorite seat in the house and sometimes he has been seen watching the students practice for an upcoming show. This seat is left empty for every performance - in case he wants to come and watch!
