When he was on his deathbed he was tied down because he kept yelling that demons were trying to get him. He was buried in his back yard in the family cemetery. At nights he has been seen walking up Leeper Hollar and there have been several reports of lights coming on and off doors being shut, and strange noises coming from his old bedroom.
