Location: Greendale Cemetery

Description:
In the cemetery, you sometimes see white or gray people, and they look un-real. If you walk by the Tebbs family graves, you feel like your being watched, get cold chills, or feel uneasy. Plus, When it's a really hot day, and there's NO wind, you'll feel a light breeze followed by a cold sensation.
