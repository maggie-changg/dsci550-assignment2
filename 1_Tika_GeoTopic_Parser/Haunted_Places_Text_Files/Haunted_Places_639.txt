Location: Lemon House

Description:
This National Historic site at the summit of the Allegheny Portage Railroad was once a tavern and inn.  It is documented that people have died in the house.  National Park Service employees have reported strange noises of banging, and of windows and doors shutting at night.  Foggy nights are the most active times.
