Location: Signal Hill

Description:
Signal Hill Hospital - Once used as a hospital for Confederate wounded during the Civil War, this building has been the site of many strange occurrences; large floating balls of light in the second building of the house, doors slamming shut, and a feeling of presence in the basement. The Signal Hill hospital is located opposite the fork in Signal Hill Rd.
