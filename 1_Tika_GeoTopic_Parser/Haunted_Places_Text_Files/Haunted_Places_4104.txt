Location: deserted railroad tunnel

Description:
was once a life for people living in the sparsely populated area of southeastern Ohio; legend has it that a railway worker was having an affair with the engineer's wife, he found out about it and ran the railroad worker over, decapitating him; you can see a headless figure walking where the tracks used to be, at night carrying a lantern, looking for his head (also be careful not to go out there by yourself, the locals do not want you around and may be aggressive in protecting their area)
