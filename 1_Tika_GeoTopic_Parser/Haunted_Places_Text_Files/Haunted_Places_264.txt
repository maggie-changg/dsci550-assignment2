Description:
Angel Lake - At one time there was an old slaughter house down by the lake. It was said to have been a house of "ill repute" before it was a slaughter house. When the ladies of the house would accidentally get pregnant they would either force an abortion or miscarry and toss the unborn fetus into the lake. they say the reason it is called angel lake is because the area around the lake is haunted by the spirits of the dead babies.
