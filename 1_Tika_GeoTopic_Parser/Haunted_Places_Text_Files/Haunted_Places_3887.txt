Location: Schrader Road Tunnel

Description:
It is said that if you drive through the tunnel with your windows down you can hear the cries of a baby that was killed there. The story says a mother and her daughter died there years ago. The fashion in which they were killed varies on who you ask. There was also a woman that hung herself (or was murdered, then hung) from the north end of the tunnel.
