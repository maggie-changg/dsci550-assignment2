Location: Six Flags California

Description:
Every night just a few hours after the park is free of all guests, the security base get a phone call from Goliath (caller identification) and when they answer, all they hear is static. After numerous calls, a few security guards investigated the matter. When the base got the call, they radioed two guards waiting on the exit ramp. When the guards ran up to the station, there was nobody around. They searched every part of the ride and found nothing but an empty feeling.
