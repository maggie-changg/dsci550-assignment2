Location: Dunn Pond State Park

Description:
A small island on Dunn Pond is said to be haunted. Occasionally bright lights are seen over the island. It is rumored that an Indian was buried on this small island that was his favorite fishing spot. - June 2008 submission debunked - the pond is man made and it was only dug in the 60's or 70's but no earlier than the 50's. If your on the other side of the ponds beach it would look as though thereâ€™s a light above the island due to the fact the park facilities building being directly behind it and it has a sodium vapor lamp on the side of the building.
