Location: JPV Woods

Description:
Every 13th of August it is said that when you go into the woods and walk along the old dirt trail, about 11:30 to 12:30 you can hear children screaming and crying for help and the little hairs on the back of your neck will rise without intention. - January 2007 Update: was torn down early 2006.
