Location: Community Prep High School was Garfield Elementary

Description:
About 40 years ago two 3rd graders committed suicide, in one of the rooms down stairs you can still feel the coldness of the two elementary students presence. Also from students who go there now say they see and hear the voices of the two children. One student said that when they were down in the room they felt something pulling their hair while sitting down in the classroom. Until this day you can still smell what the dead bodies smell like.
