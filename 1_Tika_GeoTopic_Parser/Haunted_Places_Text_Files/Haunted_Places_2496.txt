Description:
8 miles No. of Placerville/hwy 49 to Coldsprings Rd, turn left, the cemetery is up the hill on the left across from the Vineyard House. The Phantom of a lady in burgundy watches over the Schieffer family plot in the old settlers graveyard. According to the markers, William Schieffer died 1861 at age 2, Charles Schieffer died 1864 at age 42 and May Schieffer died 1890 at age 27. The ghost is a woman whose hair is parted in the middle and pulled tightly into a bun. She is wearing a long, flowing, burgundy dress and can be seen from the roadside beckoning passersby to come up to the grave site and visit with her.
