Description:
The people working the shift on the same date and time as President Harding died, the antique clock will stop and for a while and re-start, also, in his "office" on top of a tall wooden chest with glass doors sets a model ship....the sails move back and forward. - June 2008 Correction: The clock has been known to stop only three times on the date Workers have to re-start it. In reference to the story that the sails blow on the ship is completely false.
