Location: Cloquet High School

Description:
Over the stage where the lights and catwalk are the door sometimes mysteriously opens and slams shut. Many of the female actors see a white figure up there, assuming it is a techie they dismiss it. Yet, sometimes when the techies are all around the white bodiless head stares at you and once you speak disappears. This mostly happens during performances. This spirit will not show itself to men, because many scared girls attempt to show it to the boys and they can't see it, while the girls see it is plainly there.
