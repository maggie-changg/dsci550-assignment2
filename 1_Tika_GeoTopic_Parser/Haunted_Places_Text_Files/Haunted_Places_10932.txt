Location: University of Northern Colorado

Description:
Turner Hall -  Haunted by numerous spirits, chiefly, two main spirits that most of the students who reside in it know and have either seen or heard. The first spirit was a former student who threw himself out of the window of the 11th floor. Another is because of a fire that happened in one of the rooms (12th?)and trapped the students there.
