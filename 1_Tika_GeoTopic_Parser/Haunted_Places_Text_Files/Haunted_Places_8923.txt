Location: Lake Highlands High School

Description:
Supposedly sometime in the early 1970s, a girl named Elizabeth jumped out of one of the second story windows of Lake Highlands High School off of Church Rd. and White Rock Trail (near Flag Pole Hill) and killed herself. Most sightings or strange occurrences have taken place in the auditorium; however the technical theatre teacher claims he can sense her presence throughout the school. Tools were found missing from the locked tool room, trashcans and other large objects thrown across room, doors (w/ hydraulics to keep from loud slamming) were slammed shut, and random cold spots throughout the room. Some kids from LHHS made a movie about it this summer, called Ghost light.
