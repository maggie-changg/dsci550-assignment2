Description:
The Pool Area - The High School is haunted by a deceased janitor that drowned in the school's pool.  He was doing routine maintenance on the pool when he slipped on the side of the pool, hitting his head on the side and drowned.  He has been seen working on the now-fully-functional pool as well as roaming in the locker rooms.
