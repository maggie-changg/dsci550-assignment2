Location: Corriher-Lipe Middle School

Description:
Ghosts have been reported as being seen and heard in the 600 Building across from the Gym. Doors opening and closing with no one there, a hazy figure of a young girl wandering in the hallways, gusts of heavy, damp-cold air rushing through a section on the second floor, voices of children after hours, and the figure of the custodian killed by a boiler incident has been seen roaming the halls watching over the children.
