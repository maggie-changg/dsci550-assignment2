Location: West High School

Description:
It is said that in the basement auditorium and in the area where it links to the Middle School, there are restless creatures that are only semi-human in the area. They take out their anger on a lot of students and young teachers. Rumor has it that West High and its neighborhood were once an elusive, swampy forest area and the creatures hate how their land has become so polluted and contaminated.
