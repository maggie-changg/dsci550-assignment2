Location: Hollywood Cemetery

Description:
Besides the fact that the cemetery is very old with many local "celebrities" (mostly governors, senators, and a president or two) there is one tomb, Poole's, that is known as the Vampire Tomb. Supposedly the man enclosed in the building was a vampire and has been known to stalk visitors, and even attack a few, in the cemetery late at night.
