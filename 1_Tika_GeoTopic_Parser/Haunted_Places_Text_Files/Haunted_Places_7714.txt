Location: Vale Cemetery

Description:
"The Blue Lady" - They say that a ghost named Mary haunts the cemetery. People have seen blue lights rise from her grave and then slowly sinks back in. Lots of cold spots and you see a bunch of black shadows and once and a while plasma. - October 2007 Update: Strange noises heard on woods path. mist showed up in picture too.
