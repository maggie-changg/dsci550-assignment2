Location: The Skyline Lodge­

Description:
built 1945 in the tiny mining town of Platoro, Colorado. The Lodge is a 3story log/wood building and contains a general store, a restaurant, a game room, and guest/employee rooms. It stands at 10,000ft. elevation in a valley of the San Jaun Mountain Range in Southern Colorado. There is much history at the lodge and in the Platoro area in general. Platoro was founded in the early 1880's to provide housing, food and even a post office for local gold/silver miners. One of the ghosts that haunt the area/lodge is believed to be 'Little Eva'. Eva was a 16yr. old prostitute that was shot by the wife of a local miner. Her grave is an unmarked concrete slab that's in a field about 150yrds from the lodge.­ - (private property)­ - Another 'Spirit' is believed to be Henry, the ghost of a man that passed away(1950's) inside the main lodge after suffering a heart attack while hunting. Some of the mysterious things that happen are; Shadows(silhouettes)passing by/behind people when they're alone. Bowls, silverware, plates getting thrown off counters and shelves. Doors opening/shutting, even locking on there own. Numerous cold spots that are almost always there. The sound of furniture being dragged across upper floors when no one's around. Things missing and turning up in strange locations, and fires in the main lobby fireplace starting/stopping on there own.
