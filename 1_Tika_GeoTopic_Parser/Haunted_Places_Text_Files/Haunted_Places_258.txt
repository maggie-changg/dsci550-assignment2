Location: Almon House

Description:
In the early 1970's the man of the house was going to cut the grass and accidentally fell in a hole in the back yard and the mower ran over him mangling his body to an almost unrecognizable state. It is said by people who live here that they can see him walking late at night pushing the mower and also sitting on the porch with a mysterious look on his face while staring at his arm barely attached to his shoulder. It is said that he mutters incoherently while cutting the grass and sometimes when the grass has gotten too long it is short in the morning because he likes it to look nice.
