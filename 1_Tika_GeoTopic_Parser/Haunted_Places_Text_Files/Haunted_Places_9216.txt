Location: Red Ash Cemetery

Description:
There is a good 10 mile stretch in which several paranormal sightings have occurred.Â  Witnesses report a red half human, half goat figure that was nearly 8 feet tall with a pentagram in it's forehead. As they sped away, they had to cross a set of railroad tracks. Directly in front of them, there was a strange blue light that was hovering over the railroad tracks. It was about 10 feet wide.
