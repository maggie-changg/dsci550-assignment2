Location: Boon Hutch Cemetery

Description:
A ghostly police officer from the 1950's sits inside the graveyard along with a blue light. There is also a cave under the cemetery with a grave near the entrance. People have reported seeing a strange figure standing in the cave when going in. Some witnesses have even reported that bodies will fall out of their caskets into the cave. One other occurrence involves sinister looking dogs with red glowing eyes that chase people to their cars, then disappear.
