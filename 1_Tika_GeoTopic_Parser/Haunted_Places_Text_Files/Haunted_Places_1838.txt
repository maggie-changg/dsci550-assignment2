Location: Yarmouth Resort (formerly Flagship Inn)

Description:
Reports of sounds of doors slamming within indoor pool area when all doors are locked tight, items moved or placed in reception area within a matter of seconds, no known origins to these events, appearing to be a rather playful spirit, most likely a young little girl (left a baby hairclip on the counter as if to give clue to "what it is") several night-time employees get unnerved catching strange vibes, one house-keeper spotted an image of a small dog in hallway which then seemingly disappeared before her eyes.
