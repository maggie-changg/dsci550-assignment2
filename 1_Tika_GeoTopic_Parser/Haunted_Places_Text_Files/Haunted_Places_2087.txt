Location: Railroad Tracks

Description:
A light is seen at night going up and down the tracks. It is said that a man that got hit by a train and lost his head is searching for it. The light appears to be swinging, as if someone is holding it. If you can stand in its path, it disappears as it gets to you, and then reappears behind you, continuing on its path.
