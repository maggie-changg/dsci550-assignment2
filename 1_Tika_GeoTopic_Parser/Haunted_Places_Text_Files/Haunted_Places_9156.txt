Location: Cigarroa Middle School

Description:
It is said that in the section of the school known as the sixth grade hall, you can hear the bouncing of a ball which is being chased by a young boy. Janitors say that at this exact time the clocks posted at every hall start to spin like crazy and they have never been able to set them on time.
