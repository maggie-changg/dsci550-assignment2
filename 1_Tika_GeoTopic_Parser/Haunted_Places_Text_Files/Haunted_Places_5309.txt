Location: Stull Cemetery and abandoned church- Update: The church has since been torn down

Description:
Stull is said to be one of the six gateways to hell. The devil had a child with a local witch. The witch was hung in a tree and the boy was killed. The tree that she was hung from fell over and opened a gateway to hell. Many stories say that a large group of people went out into the cemetery on Halloween and the next day they were found all slaughtered. Witnesses report a demon like creature watching them from the doorway of the abandoned church on the hill of the cemetery. Do not go in the cemetery. Many bad things could happen.
