Location: Mansfield mine cave-in

Description:
In the late 1800's when iron ore mining was in its prime, a group of 27 miners were killed when the mine caved in and drowned them. People who live close by can sometimes hear screaming and noises like someone was hitting a pick against a rock. Apparitions can be seen in and around the water where the mine filled with water. Lights of the mining helmets are seen coming from below the water.
