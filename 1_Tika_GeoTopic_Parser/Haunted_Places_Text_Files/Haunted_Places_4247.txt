Location: Devil's Heart Beat

Description:
There is this old bridge in Vermilion. It's abandoned and dangerous to use. But, at night, if you drive your car across it, your car will stall, then you'll see a blinding blue light. Then, you here a booming sound, like a heartbeat. After about 5 minutes, it disappears and then your car will start up like nothing happen.
