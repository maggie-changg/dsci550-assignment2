Location: West Point USMA

Description:
Being that West Point is the oldest military post in the United States the area has it's fair share of "history". All you have to do is ask a Military Police officer or a cadet and you should get a good idea of where to look. I'll tell you what, this isn't for the faint of heart, you spend enough time here and you will see something.
