Location: Josephina's Restaurant

Description:
Larimer Square- Haunted by a female regular whose daughter from the prohibition era (the restaurant used to be a speak-easy) earlier in the century. The mirror in the women's bathroom has broken one-too-many times to be a coincidence as well as other freaky things (i.e. Whiskey bottles turning over by themselves, chair scooting from one end of the dining room to the other, etc.)
