Location: Highlands High School

Description:
Highlands High School is haunted by a former student named David Cecil. He was a football player and suffered a fatal accident during a home football game. What was the locker room at the time was turned into the music/band room and is constantly full of paranormal activity. Chimes will swing, symbols will slide down the split-level floor, his "spot" gets icy cold when it's disturbed, trophies will fall from the shelves, and a door with no knob or lock will shake uncontrollably as if someone were locked inside that closet (you hear and see this as it happens), and the TV goes on and off "by itself". And sometimes, during home games if you look into the band room from the stands of David Cecil Memorial Stadium, you can see a figure of a teenage boy peering through the window even though no one is allowed access after school hours but the band members
