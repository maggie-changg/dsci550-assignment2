Location: The Old School House

Description:
What used to be an old, one-room schoolhouse, is now said to inhibit guests from the paranormal realm. It is said a former teacher, by the name of Ms. Van moss, would abuse the children so badly that one day after a playground mishap, Vanmoss struck a child so hard in the head that the child died immediately. Today, the schoolhouse is a well know restaurant, but the customers report seeing a small child sitting solemnly alone at a booth in the corner. There have also been reports of silver wear being randomly thrown across the room.
