Location: Mount Misery

Description:
Freezing cold spots. Mist. It's all woods with dirt winding roads that never end. There's a cross in the middle of nowhere. Witnesses report that there were cars behind them then they disappeared out of nowhere like they weren't even there, sick feelings & apparitions of a woman. The cross is not in the middle of nowhere. It is part of the Green Cathedral. People get married and children are christened there. It is a place of worship for the staff & campers during the summer - as well as other guests throughout the year. There is an arch on the ball field with a cross on it. If you go down the steps there are benches to sit on an altar.
