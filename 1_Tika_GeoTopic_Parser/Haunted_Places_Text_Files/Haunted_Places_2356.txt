Location: Tigard High School

Description:
Deb Fennel Auditorium - Stories of a ghost that inhabited this part of the school. It is said to be that of a former male student that went to the school who died during his senior year and now haunts this Auditorium. There are rumors of hearing things and seeing ghostly images. Most of the hauntings are in the "general mischief" category, such as lights being turned on, papers moved around, etc. When ever something strange would happen, the students blame it on the ghost.
