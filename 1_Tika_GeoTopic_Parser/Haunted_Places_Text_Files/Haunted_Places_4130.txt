Location: Siesta Motel

Description:
In 1994, a man who lived about ten miles away got in a heated argument with his mother. The man was known to be very ignitable and he stormed out of their house and booked a room at the Siesta Motel. Later that night his mother found out where he was and called him, making him even angrier. A short while after the man went to sleep, he was awaken by the sound of someone in his room. Assuming it was his mother stepping out of bounds, and enraged, he attacked the figure in the dark. When a struggle broke out, the robber accidentally killed the man. The ghost roams over the entire building, slamming doors, turning lights off, whispering vulgarities, a few reports of crying and laughter combined, taking things and putting them in odd places, and people have reported being hit by the dark haired man.
