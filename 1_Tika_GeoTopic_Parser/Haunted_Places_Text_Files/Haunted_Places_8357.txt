Location: Twin Churches

Description:
Two identical churches sit side by side, hence the name Twin Churches, and the older one is said to be haunted. The older one was said to have had a curse put on it by a preacher who was caught running around with a congregation member, so they moved out and build the new identical church. Several stories are told about the older church, one is of a Bible that is in the front of the church that gets heavier and heavier if one tries to leave with it. Other stories go on to say if you drive around it a certain number of times at midnight, your car will stop and not start back for some time. People have also claimed to see heads hanging from a rope in front of the church.
