Location: Clairmont Springs Hotel

Description:
Built over an Indian burial ground. Back in 1972, a train hit a six year-old girl across the street. Every night at midnight trains go by every five seconds. Meanwhile, in the hotel, a ghost roams around and they say you can hear the six year-old running through the halls.
