Description:
Atkin Hall - Atkin-Colby Hall is 10 stories tall plus penthouses--what we call the eleventh floors. The building opened in the fall of 1962. The elevators only go up to the tenth floor; you have to take stairs from there to the eleventh floors. The eleventh floors are generally locked and used for storage. I believe people originally lived in them, although nobody has for years. The eleventh floor of Atkin has a presence in it. Nobody seems to know what could have caused a haunting up there, and I don't think a ghost has ever been sighted. But there seems to be a very strong negative presence. You can even feel it on the landing--outside that locked door. I know people who won't go up there alone at night.
