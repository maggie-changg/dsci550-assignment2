Location: Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic

Description:
There have been many reports of toilets flushing by themselves and the feeling of being watched/followed by workers in the early morning hours. The ghost is said to be that of a doctor who went on a fishing trip, but never returned. He is believed to have drowned on that fateful trip.
