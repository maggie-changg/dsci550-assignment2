Location: The Yellow Motel

Description:
there have been notes of white dogs chasing cars that pull into the drive way. People have seen people hanging form trees and working in fields in old clothing. This motel is where Al Capone did some of his work and had meetings in a secret place in the tunnels. The motel was once painted blue but the next day it was back to yellow. - March 2007 update: was torn down and a tennis court was built over it.
