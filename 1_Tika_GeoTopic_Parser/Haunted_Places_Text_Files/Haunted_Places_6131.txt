Location: Lincoln High School

Description:
Mainly occurs in the balcony of the auditorium. Unexplained lights flashing on and off in the light booth when it has been locked and nobody is in there. Seats of the wooden folding chairs swinging up and down when nobody is around. Cold spots in certain areas. The curtains on the stage will rustle in a seemingly non-existent breeze when there is nothing that could cause it. There is no air conditioning in the school. There have also been unexplained noises such as tapping on the wooden floor of the stage, and banging on the seats in the balcony. If you go into the Paint Room, which is located in one of the wings of the stage, you get the feeling of someone watching you, and running their fingers up and down your back.
