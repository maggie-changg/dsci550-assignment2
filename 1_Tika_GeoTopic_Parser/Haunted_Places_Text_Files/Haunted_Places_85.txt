Location: Russelville ballroom

Description:
people report seeing a man run in the woods, orbs around the building ,faces looking out the window. The place is closed down now and seems not to be able to stay open. When it was open people would report dishes moving and pots and pans falling from where they are at .on the dance floor people report seeing ghost dance.December 2006 â€“ update: About a year ago a bad wind storm collapsed the porch roof of the building, and buckled parts of the walls. The building is considered unsafe and will most likely be torn down soon.
