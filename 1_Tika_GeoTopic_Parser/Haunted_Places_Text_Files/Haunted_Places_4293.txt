Location: Ghost Lake

Description:
Ghost Lake is located on Shades of Death Road in Allamuchy Township the local legends vary - but the prevailing theme is that there was an Indian Graveyard there and settlers built a man made lake over the graveyard. At night the Indians haunt the area - even we (locals) stay away. Plus there are MANY bear families there so be careful.
