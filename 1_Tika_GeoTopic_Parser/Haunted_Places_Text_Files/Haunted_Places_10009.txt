Location: The Death Cellar

Description:
It's the house of the resident C.W. Farquhar. It has been known by many people that have stayed in the basement long enough. The doors will lock. The lights will turn a light red color. Screams of many young girls. And full figured ghosts seen laying on the ground screaming. In 1975 a man brought many young girls to the basement and slowly killed them.
