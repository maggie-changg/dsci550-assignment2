Location: Kunkle's Mansion

Description:
The story behind it is there was a rich doctor and his family living there long ago, and a jealous murder murdered him and his wife in the bathtub, and both their kids on the swing set out back. Rumor has it that when you walk up to the mansion, you are supposed to feel the murderer follow you until you set foot on the mansion, then you're safe. To physically get to the mansion, you must park along a creek and walk about 25 minutes through the woods and 2 open fields. The house sits in the middle of the woods, is 3 stories high and totally ransacked. -  December Update: Kunkel's Mansion is off limits now, not that it ever wasn't. But there are now signs posted at the fields stating that they are patrolled. We have recieved conflicting reports on this haunted place. Around the area, adifferent submitter reports it is a gaming area. regardless, it may be best to stay away. entering a building with out permission is tresspassing, even when it seems it does not belong to anyone.
