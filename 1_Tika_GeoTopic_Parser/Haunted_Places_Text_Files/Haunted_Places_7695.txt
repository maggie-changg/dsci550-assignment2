Description:
Mary Lyon Residence Hall - built in the 1800â€™s. Rumored to be haunted. There is said to be a girl who haunts the basement of Mary Lyon, and she is supposedly a very malicious spirit. Students who venture down to the basement at night report feeling an extremely strong negative energy, as well as a feeling that drives them to leave the basement as quickly as possible. Mary Lyon is also in the under ground tunnels on this side, believed to possibly trying to meet up with her lover on the Blair Residence side.
