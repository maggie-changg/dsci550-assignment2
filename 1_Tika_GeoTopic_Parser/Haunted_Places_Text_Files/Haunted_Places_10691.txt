Description:
Dead Mans Curve -  On the side of the road in dead mans curve you can see an old ghost like figure sitting in a rocking chair on certain nights, when the moon is right. It is believed by many that the mans son was ran over and killed in the curve, so he sat there waiting on the driver of the car who killed his son until he died, but his spirit lives on and still waits on the driver.
