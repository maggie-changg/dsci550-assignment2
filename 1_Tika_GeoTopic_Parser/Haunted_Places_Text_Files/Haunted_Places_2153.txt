Location: O'Kane building

Description:
Many people have reported seeing ghostly smoke, weird lights, footsteps, and voices. On the ground floor, in a restaurant, people have reported a ghostly voice (maybe of a long-dead waitress) shouting names and orders. The basement of the building is also haunted by the ghost of an old man.
