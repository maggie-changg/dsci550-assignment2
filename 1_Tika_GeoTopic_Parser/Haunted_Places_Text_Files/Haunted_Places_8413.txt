Location: The Packing House

Description:
Off of Packinghouse road an abandoned meat packing plant exists. Shadows can be seen trying to escape the building but will go no Farther than the entranceways. On a full moon, a gunshot can be heard and the screams of burning victims accompany it. Every other night look at the 2nd window from the right on the 3rd story to see a woman with a look of terror on her face. On the backside of the building there are extreme temperature drops.
