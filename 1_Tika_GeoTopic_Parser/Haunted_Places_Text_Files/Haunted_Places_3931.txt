Location: Woodland Cemetery

Description:
at this cemetery there are many weird and unusual things that go on all though out many nights. There is one walking tomb kind of thing that the picture bleeds on certain nights because the ballerina that is buried there - got shot 2 times in the head and every time the picture is replaced the bullet holes and the bleeding come again. - This part of the story is untrue.a descendent of the ballerina would like to say that She was killed in a car accident in Illinois. We are not sure if there is even activity there.
