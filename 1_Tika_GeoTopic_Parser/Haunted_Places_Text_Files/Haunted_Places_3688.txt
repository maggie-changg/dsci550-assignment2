Location: The Carter Mansion

Description:
Haunted by the ghost of Sally Carter, who is buried on the Carter Estate. She has been sited walking the grounds. Some say she is responsible for toppling her headstone on occasion. - December 2006 Update: The body of Sally Carter has been moved to Maple Hill Cemetery in an unmarked grave. Sally still haunts the Carter Mansion. She throws pillows and moves the furniture around. The house is now in a gated community. Unless you have an appointment, you will have trouble getting in. No trespassing!
