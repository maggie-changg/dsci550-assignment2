Location: Webster Elementary School

Description:
The newly abandoned school has many beliefs about its hauntings. In and area around the bottom level girls bathroom their is a door that has remains of a boy that was playing around near the boys bathroom on the other side. He weirdly slipped and hit his head on the wet floor. He died instantly. Someone but no one is sure who, moved his body to the little strange door. This may or may not be true.
