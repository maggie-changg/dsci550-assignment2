Location: Gravity Hill

Description:
It was once said that a woman and her kid and dog were killed when their car stalled and an 18-wheeler came by and hit them instantly. And from that day on, if you park at the bottom of the hill and cut your car off, she is known to push you back up the hill out of harms ways.
