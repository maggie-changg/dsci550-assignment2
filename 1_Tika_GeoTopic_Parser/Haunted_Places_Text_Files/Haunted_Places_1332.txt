Location: Belchertown State School

Description:
Doors unlocked and propped open slam shut and lock. Running footsteps, screams and cries can be heard throughout the building. Temperatures fluctuate between extremes in a matter of minutes. There is also a part of the property near the woods that surrounds the school where nothing grows. There are now no trespassing signs around the property.
