Location: Wet Seal Co. Hulen Mall

Description:
It has been said that the land was built on an old Indian burial ground. Who's to say if anything has happened in other stores, because we have heard stories, but our experiences have been the most recent and haunting. Several associates have worked there for three years and all have several stories. One recent experience is the heavy wooden doors that are locked when no one is in them open and slam on their own. The back door that opens to the outside of the mall is locked for security reasons tends to shake mysteriously, you can watch it shake violently. People are being pulled across the room by their hair, with the store closed and no one around. Voices, cool winds in the backroom, sightings when store lights are off and store is locked. Clothes and display carts moved when store is empty besides employees. Several employees see an Indian girl sitting Indian style on the floor when store is closed and lights are off.
