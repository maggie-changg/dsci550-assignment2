Location: Buffalo Bill Codys' House

Description:
So after on of our concerts in North Platte, my band mates decided to go out to the famous Buffalo Bill Codysâ€™ house, looking up at the window we saw a vision of a little girl. The curtains were moving around while there was no wind, perfectly clear night. The little girl looked to be glowing around the edges as she moved her hand around.
