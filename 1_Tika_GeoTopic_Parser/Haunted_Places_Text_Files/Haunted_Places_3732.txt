Location: Huntingdon College

Description:
The Red Lady haunts one of the old dorms here called Pratt. She always wears all red. After committing suicide, she has appeared to several people. Another ghost on the campus is called, “The Ghost on the Green”. He shot himself on the green and he still walks the green at night. You can't see him, but you can feel him. He will tug at your clothes or blow in your ear or mess with your hair.
