Location: C.E. Vail Gym

Description:
In 1978 there was a suicide by a young girl who hung herself in the gym. For many years students and Faculty workers claimed to have seen her. A Custodian was once cleaning the gym at 5:30 and claimed to have seen her walking with a rope in her hand. Also students reported to teachers that the young girl had chased them out of the gym. Back then the school use to be a high school now it is an elementary. The gym has been demolished and was said to be built on an old cemetery.
