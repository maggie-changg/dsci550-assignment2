Description:
NASA/GSFC - Bldg #07/10/15/29 complex - late one night, there was a guard that had duty in this complex of buildings. She was watching TV in the area where her desk was! she heard some one coming up the stairs. she got up to look and no one was there. as she was watching and looking she heard the footsteps go down the stairs...she shook it off and figured it was her imagination...until it happened again...only this time when the step went down she saw the door open and a small trash can lid flip over several times and the outer most door opened...this guard refused to ever step foot in this bldg again. another guard was walking up the stairs when he passed through what appeared to be a dark spot/ or shadow...this spot was the shadow of a man he saw the shadow proceeded down the stairs past him! yet another guard was looking down into the clean room and saw what appeared to be a shadow of a man glide across the floor! This complex was the sight of a death, while the High bay was being built, a worker fell from the scaffolding and fell to his death! the rest of the building shares various sightings! And strange feelings and occurrences!
