Location: City Hall

Description:
The Council Chambers has been haunted for many years. Officers finishing paperwork late at night, have heard loud footsteps and banging above their heads usually very late at night when the building is deserted.  On one occasion, an officer heard something say, "pssst!" from the hallway.  On turning around, there was nothing there.  Fleeting apparitions have also been seen.
