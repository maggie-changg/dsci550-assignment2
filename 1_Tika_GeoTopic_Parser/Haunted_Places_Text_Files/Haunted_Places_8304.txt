Location: Lawrenceville

Description:
Clayton St. Funeral home - built in the early 1900's, originally a four room funeral home, converted to residential in the 20's, is home to 2 "suicide" victims who have been seen roaming the grounds. Electrical devices are strangely affected, doors and windows open and close on occasion, and multiple persons have seen “ghostly” figures. Don't linger on the street too long.
