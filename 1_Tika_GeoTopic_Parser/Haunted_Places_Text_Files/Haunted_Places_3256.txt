Location: Near the old stables and the old barracks

Description:
When I was in high school I went up to Ft. Washita about twice a year for Civil War Reenacting.. A couple of us guys were sitting out side on the 2nd floor deck looking out toward the old stables. And we saw a green apparition walking across the field going toward the stable. And we also saw apparitions in the old barracks.
