Location: J.F.K. Library Third

Description:
Floor South -  The story is that some people who had been getting stoned in the third floor bathroom, experimented with some laced substances. Resulting in a loss of their sanity and the bludgeoning of one of them and at least one other. On the evenings near closing time, after hours, and in the early morning the faucets turn themselves on and off, as well as locked doors being forced open. There have also been reports of cold spots in the restroom and in the area surrounding the bathroom. There is an eerie feeling in that area and sometimes you can hear stoned laughter.
