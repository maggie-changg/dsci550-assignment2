Location: East Street Cemetery

Description:
In the cemetery at night, there is a ghost of a woman who walks around the part of cemetery closest to the center of town. In addition, deep in the cemetery, there is a creature (probably never human) with dark leathery skin who will follow you as you walk through the cemetery. East Street runs through the cemetery. As you drive though, there will often be white apparitions through the cemetery.
