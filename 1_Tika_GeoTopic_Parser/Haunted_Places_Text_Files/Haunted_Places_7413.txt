Description:
home Thomas Jefferson - Monticello employees have often heard him whistling on the grounds, as he was know to do during his living days. Apparitions of a 10 year old boy wearing a uniform and a tri-cornered hat peering out a 2nd floor window. During the house tour the tour guide said that no one was allowed upstairs because of the fire codes. They knew nothing of the boy.
