Location: Tropicana Hotel &amp; Casino

Description:
Over the years visitors to this hotel are greeted at the entrance by a large tiki mask face, and many people have reported getting a terrible purple rash after touching it. And when people take pictures in front of it they report seeing a strange purple hazy cloud of smoke in the picture after they developed the pictures.
