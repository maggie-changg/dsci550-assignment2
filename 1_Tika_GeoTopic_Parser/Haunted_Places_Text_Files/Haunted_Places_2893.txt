Location: ASP Cellblock 3

Description:
In 1973, officers Buckely and Morey were killed in the cellblock by inmates during a riot. Both officers were beaten and stabbed to death. On a number of occasions, when guards would lock all of the doors in the cellblock, they would find doors open between inmate counts. A number of the officers also noticed cold spots and the sounds of doors opening and closing. Several officers noticed misty forms at the end of the cellblock on a number of occasions. The cellblock is located in the same prison as the Arizona Death House, which is also haunted.
