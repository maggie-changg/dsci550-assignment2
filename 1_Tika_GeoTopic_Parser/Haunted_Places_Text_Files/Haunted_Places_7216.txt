Location: St. Joseph's College

Description:
There is said to be a spirit in the chapel of St. Joseph's College. Sometimes at night, there is a light that is visible at the very top of the chapel. The light is only seen by lovers who are walking on the campus. When you look back at the light, you won't see anything.
