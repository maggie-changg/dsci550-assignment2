Description:
passed gravity hill - it was said that in a barn near gravity hill they raped girls and killed them. Some high school kids decided to go and hang out. It is called gravity hill because on the hill if you put your car in neutral it will roll up hill. But if you put dirt of powder of some sort you can see fingerprints. Some kids were there and they were in a truck and there were three people the one in the middle turned to look at the passenger, he was in the middle, it looked like he wanted to cry. He leaned forward and saw the face of a girl inches away from his face. They said that all you can see is the outline of her eyes with long black hair over her face. They said that it looked like she had come out of the canal cause her hair looked wet but it couldnâ€™t be. There was no water in the canal. Another time a high school student was driving by the canal alone one night in November. He was terrified to see a young woman with long black hair jump into the canal off of a little bridge over the canal. Some other kids were at the hill. They turned their car off. The car begs to move. They looked back and a young woman was trying to push the car, as if she wanted to them to leave.
