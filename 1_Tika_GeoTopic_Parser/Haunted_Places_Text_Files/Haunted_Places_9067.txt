Location: the shadows

Description:
It is said that if you go into the shadows late at night and park your car and turn everything off you can hear voices and people walking around. After a while rocks will even be thrown at your car. And knocks on your back window. If you try to out of your car you will feel a cold presence even in the middle of summer.
