Location: Townsend Manor Inn

Description:
Tapping on the window, scratching at the door, the lights flickered and turned off without us turning them off. - February 2004 update / additional info: Be careful not to confuse this haunted house with the Raynham Hall in Norfolk, England. There is a connection though; the Raynham Hall in Oyster Bay was named after the one in England. The Townsend family still holds ownership of Raynham Hall in Norfolk.
