Location: St. Philips Graveyard

Description:
The ghost of Sue Howard who's baby died still haunts the place, and is said to frequently attack women who are pregnant or have had miscarriages. There is also proof of her existence by a photograph taken by a photographer in the 80's doing a piece on Charleston's graveyards.
