Location: Farmington Cemetery

Description:
On Grand River just past Farmington road there is a cemetery that is haunted. If you are leaving through the west gate, which is on a hill, and you put your car in neutral, your car is mysteriously "pushed" up the hill and out of the gate of the Cemetery. - April 2007 update â€“ a group went to investigate this haunting and found nothing. Further, they found no facts that it has ever really happened or have been recorded to happen.
