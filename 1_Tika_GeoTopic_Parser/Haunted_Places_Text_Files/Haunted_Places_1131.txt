Description:
Alumni Hall - Aside from the abnormal creaks in the floors and walls when no one is nearby, at least four known students have complained about waking up in the middle of the night and being 'held' by some force. The students could not move their arms or legs for a period of roughly 5 minutes when, abruptly it stopped and everyone was free to move again. It was a Civil War hospital in the 1860's. Three counselors and a teenage camper all claim to have heard a woman's voice call their respective names at around between 3:15 and 3:30 AM. Many of the instances happened when there was no one there. Counselors have been threatened of be fired if they tell any of the students. In addition footsteps can be heard at all times of the night when there is no one in the vicinity.
