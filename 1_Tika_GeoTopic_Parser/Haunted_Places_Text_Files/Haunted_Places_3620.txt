Location: Banks Middle School

Description:
At the sixth grade section of the girls bathroom on Halloween, you can hear doors slamming shut while you are in class. Also, many years ago a teacher killed herself by jumping off the airplane that sits on top of the building. It is said that a disruptive student drove her crazy. Also, on Halloween the intercom will just click on by itself.
