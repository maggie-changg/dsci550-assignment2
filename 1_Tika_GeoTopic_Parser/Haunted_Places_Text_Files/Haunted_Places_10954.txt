Location: Littleton Cemetery

Description:
Alfred Packer, the alleged cannibal is buried here. While he seems to rest in peace, Angelica, a goat that was supposed to serve as a medium for him, supposedly haunts the graveyard. If you aren't impressed with a medium-goat, go for Alfie's grave and the other lovely old graves. Since it is a Cemetery, It's probably open to the public, but locked at night. The Littleton Cemetery is actually just up the road from the melting pot- two trips for one!
