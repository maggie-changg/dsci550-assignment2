Location: Laredo Community College

Description:
The site of the Laredo Community College is actually an old fort. A lot of the old buildings are still up and either used as classrooms or offices. The thing is if you check the campus maps there used to be a cemetery that went with it, which is where people claim to have seen apparitions.
