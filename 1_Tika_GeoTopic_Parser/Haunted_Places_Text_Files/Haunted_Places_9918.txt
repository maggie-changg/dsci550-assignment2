Location: Wentworth Military Academy

Description:
Marine Hall - The showers come on by themselves and hear footsteps coming down the hall but nobody was there. Marine Hall is said to be haunted, but it was also off-limits to the cadets. A little boy is said to come out at night sometimes and salute the helicopter then disappear. - April 2007 Update: it has been demolished
