Location: Subway

Description:
The Canonsburg Subway was said to have been built on an old nursing home. The employees there have experienced a ghost whispering their names in their ears, swinging of the doors even though they are the only person in the store, and even report seeing a shadowy figure in the security camera again when no one is present in the store. They have dubbed the ghost "Fred".
