Location: Lake Erie College

Description:
College Hall - There's a ghost named Stephanie who haunts mostly the 4th floor, which is closed off now, but they say she can get downstairs through a mirror in the social parlor. She roams everywhere and many people have seen her. She is said to be a student from the 1800's when it used to be an all girl college and later she killed herself in the belfry. She is very nice though. Non- threatening.
