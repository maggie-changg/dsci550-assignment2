Location: Fort Delaware

Description:
This site (now a state park) was used as to imprison Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. Many workers and tourists have seen ghostly images, felt cold places and heard voices. On a recent "ghost tour" visitors actually saw the image of a Confederate soldier watching them from the upper ramparts. Also on this island site was once a cemetery for soldiers who died of typhus and malaria and this is supposed to be haunted as well.
