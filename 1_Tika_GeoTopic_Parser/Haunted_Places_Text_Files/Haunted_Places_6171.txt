Location: Mt Hope Cemetery

Description:
Toward the back of the cemetery there are five graves of children from the same family. One of them is Sara. She likes to follow visitors around and several have said they hear a child's voice asking for Ree. If she is not answered she will tug at clothes and touch people.
