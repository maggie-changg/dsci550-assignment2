Location: The Old Han-Dee Mart Building

Description:
An old lady named Marie came into the store daily. After she passed away, odd things began to happen. Employees reported odd feelings when in the back room by the cooler; the remote control Christmas lights changing rotation only on second shift and once, a stack of paperwork slid off a shelf, sat in the air momentarily, and then fell to the floor. A customer and two employees once witnessed a loud scream. Customers outside pumping gas heard nothing. The old Han-Dee Mart building was sold and is being converted to an office building.
