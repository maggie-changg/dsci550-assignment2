Description:
Several ghosts reportedly haunt this place. A woman and young child can be seen in the basement, along with a man wearing Revolutionary War type clothing. By an employee's account, a ghost hunter asked to spend the night alone there once. In the morning, the owner returned to find the ghost hunter's equipment, but the ghost hunter was never seen afterwards.
