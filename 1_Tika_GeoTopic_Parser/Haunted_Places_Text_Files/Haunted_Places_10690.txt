Location: Lyman Lake

Description:
They say back in the old days around Lyman lake that there was a party there and a girl got raped and killed down there. If you go out there around like 12:00 at night you can hear a girl screaming and sometimes (very rare though) you can see a faint glowing light over in the trees.
