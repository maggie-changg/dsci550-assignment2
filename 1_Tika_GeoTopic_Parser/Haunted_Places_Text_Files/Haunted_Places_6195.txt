Description:
Graham Hall - A room that is locked up, believed to be haunted by the Penguin Lady. Residents have held sheets of paper under her door to watch her grab them with a sucking action, and later when the room is unlocked by staff, the residents find the paper placed neatly atop an extra desk or dresser.
