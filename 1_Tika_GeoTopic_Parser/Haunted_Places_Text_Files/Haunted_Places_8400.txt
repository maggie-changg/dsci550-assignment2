Location: Savannah River

Description:
The woman known as The Waving Girl, Florence Martus, was immortalized in a statue on the Savannah River for her habit of waving a cloth or towel from the land as a helpful signal to boats coming in. The statue depicts her waving with a large dog sitting next to her. Many times the stone cloth has been seen waving as if in the wind. Many believe it to be haunted by a ghost boy who broke little children and animals necks. It is said he was hung near the river. On calm, autumn, under a full moon you can see him walking looking for victims.
