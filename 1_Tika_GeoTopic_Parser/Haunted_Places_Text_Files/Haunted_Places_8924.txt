Location: Lawrence Hotel

Description:
opened in October 1925--crying and shadows on 10th fl. allegedly woman jumped or fell from presidential suite back in the 40's--often heard voices and footsteps and many cold spots---high heeled footsteps back and forth across the lobby between midnight and 6am---gentleman gambler on 2nd level where there used to be an illegal casino during the late 20'-30's--lots of movement in the basement areas too. - March 2007 Update/ Correction: There are other Internet rumors that the illegal gambling casino was in the basement. This is not accurate. The casino was in fact on the second floor. However, laundry carts have been reported by the staff to move on their own in the basement. The front desk will often get calls from (3) rooms in the hotel on a regular basis that no one has checked into. The 10th floor has one room in particular (room #1009) where the staff say when they try to open the door to the room they get resistance on the other side as if someone doesn't want you to come in. Lots of activity has been captured in this room. A congressman also lived in the hotel at one time who also killed himself at the hotel. He lived on the 10th floor. Female voices are heard in the hall.
