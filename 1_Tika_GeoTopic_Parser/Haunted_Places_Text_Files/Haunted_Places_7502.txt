Location: USS Cole

Description:
In the Engineering space where the ship was hit if you are working alone your tools will be moved on you and you can feel a presence of someone watching you. In the Hall of Heroes by the mess decks you can hear your name being called by an unseen woman. The ghosts just want to let people know that they are watching us
