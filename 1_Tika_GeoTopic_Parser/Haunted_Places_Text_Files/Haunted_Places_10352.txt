Location: Cedar Hill Metal Institution

Description:
There is an old metal institution which is now boarded up. Many people committed suicide in this place. A man hung himself. You can see little orbs and figures glowing. You can also hearing moaning and other noises. There is now a new metal institution, which has patients in it right now, but this old institution is still there, boarded up, old and full of disturbed souls that may never leave.
