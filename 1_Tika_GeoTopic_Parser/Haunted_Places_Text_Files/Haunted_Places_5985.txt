Location: West Hall

Description:
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute - This building served as a hospital prior to becoming a classroom building for RPI. The ghost of a lady in white is often seen walking the halls. She is said to be a nurse that died in a fire that gutted the building while trying to save children. The ghost is welcomed and well liked. Signs jokingly say things such as "Please turn off the lights for the ghost when you leave."
