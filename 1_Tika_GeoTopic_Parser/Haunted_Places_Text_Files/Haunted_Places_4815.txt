Location: Camp Geiger

Description:
Footsteps and screaming in the land navigation woods on the base right outside of Camp Devil Dog. Sometimes, a young girl will come out to the road. If you're female, she will stand there and play with her hair and look at the ground. But many males have said she sees them and screams. She is very beautiful, but has wide bright eyes that seem to see right behind you at all times. Some believe she is the young mistress of a military officer, hanged to death because she fell in love with him and would have told his wife. However, the loop in the noose was too wide for her slender neck and se died days later from either asphyxiation or hunger. Some others say she is a body that was found in the swamp in the back of the woods.
