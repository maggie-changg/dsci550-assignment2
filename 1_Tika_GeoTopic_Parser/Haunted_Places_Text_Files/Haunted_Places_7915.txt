Location: Waikiki / Diamond Head

Description:
Le Pietra School - when you walk there, it feels as if children are following you. I have had a light but gentle wind blow past me, in the wind I have heard children playing and laughing. I have worked the area for many years and there is no physical reason for this. On the back or mountainside of the school, it feels as if there is some strong willed or minded male watching, like a guard or warrior and it follow you at a distance.
