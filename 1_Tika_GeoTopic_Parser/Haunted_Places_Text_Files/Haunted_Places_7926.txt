Location: J Quad Building 846

Description:
Hearing mumbling voices, body paralyzed, and your can hear someone in the room with you laughing, pulling on your blankets. A lot of the rooms here are haunted by WWII soldiers, some ghost don't bother you but let you know theyâ€™re there by knocking on stuff walking around in the hallways, but some are evil and will show you that!
