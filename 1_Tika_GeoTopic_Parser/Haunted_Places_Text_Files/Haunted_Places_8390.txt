Location: Isle of Hope

Description:
Camp Villamarie - Everyone who has ventured through this area with us has claimed to see the same things,.... we all hear children playing and see blue outlines of things moving and hear swing sets when there are none in the area and see bright lights go on and off in uncontrollable areas. It is near the site of an old battle from the civil war. KY
