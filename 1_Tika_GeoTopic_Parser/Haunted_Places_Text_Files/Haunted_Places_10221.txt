Location: Rock n Roll Graveyard

Description:
Back in the woods there is a little round graveyard. You have to enter by the gate. At night there is a lady ghost in white, rocking in a rocking chair. The gate has closed on people who were trying to leave, and the lady ghost comes closer and closer to people. It is advised to never visit this haunted site at night. The gate is closed to visitors after hours now.
