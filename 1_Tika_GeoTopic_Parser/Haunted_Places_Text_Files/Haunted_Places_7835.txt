Location: Virginia City Cemetery

Description:
There have been reports from visitors to the cemetery after dark, of a certain gravestone that emits a strange light from far away. When the people try to find it, the light disappears. There is also a man's gravestone that moves from his gravesite frequently, although the guards report that no one has entered the cemetery, and it is a rather large piece of stone for a normal human to move, and it requires three people at least to move it back.
