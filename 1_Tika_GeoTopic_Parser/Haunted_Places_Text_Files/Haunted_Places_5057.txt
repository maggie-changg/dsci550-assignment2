Location: Morehead State University

Description:
Buttin Auditorium -  in the 1980's a janitor was cleaning a large clock hanging off the balcony and apparently he fell off the balcony and a chair broke his back and sometimes if you're sitting in the area he fell on you get a crushing sensation and a very odd smell.
