Location: Raritan Library

Description:
Raritan township library, Raritan The old library keeper haunts this place nightly, turning on lights and moving books, there have been numerous sightings of the elderly woman in the window and the old garden behind it. I live around there and have seen lights go on and off at very odd hours. They say she died there, many old buildings and strange stories of hauntings.
