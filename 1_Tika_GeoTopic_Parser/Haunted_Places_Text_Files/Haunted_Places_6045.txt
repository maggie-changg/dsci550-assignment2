Location: Old Fort Niagara

Description:
Revolutionary War re-enactors at the fort spent a night with friends in the building near Lake Ontario and one of their friends was pushed from the bed she was in during the night. Everyone heard bumping and other noises. Also, the night before a big reenactment, a man was wandering around camp asking people if they had enough powder. He was limping, dirty and had a strange accent. Someone noticed he was wearing the uniform of a regiment that was not reenacted at that time. It became the talk of the camp that a number of people had spoken with a ghost.- March 2007 Additional Information: The French Castle at the fort is where most of the paranormal experiences have occurred.
