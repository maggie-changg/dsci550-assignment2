Description:
Janitors working over night tell stories of doors in the stock room opening and closing by themselves. They also reported seeing signs hanging from the ceiling swaying back and forth like they were being tapped in a row. A night stocker witnessed a 10-foot section of talking Elmoâ€™s all begin talking and moving at the same time. They are not sound activated. And there is an ominous presence that can be felt in the closed auto service center.
