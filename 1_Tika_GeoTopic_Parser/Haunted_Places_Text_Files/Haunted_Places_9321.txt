Description:
Mary White Dormitory - Mary white is said to be haunted by a girl who was murdered. Two roommates were staying for a few days before leaving for Christmas break. In a few towns over a murderer had escaped from a prison. The girls were told to keep their door locked. One of the girls needed to use the restroom. They developed a secret knock so that the other girl would know who it was. The girl left to go to the bathroom and the door was locked behind her. The girl was gone for about 30 minutes and then the girl in the room heard two knocks on the door. She did not open the door, because it was not the secret knock, but kept it locked and made no sound. Several hours later the girl walked out into the hallway to find the hall covered in blood and her roommate dead on the floor. Apparently, the murderer broke into the hall and killed the girl. She haunts the hall and plays tricks on the residents. TVs are known to turn on and off. Doors slam, showers turn on, rooms are trashed, refrigerator doors open, doorknobs fall off, and posters are torn off of the walls.
