Location: Camberly Gunter Hotel

Description:
The Camberly Gunter Hotel is haunted by the ghost of a prostitute who was murdered there by one of her tricks in the early 1960's. The room she was murdered in was found covered in blood but no body was ever found. A picture of her hangs in the Lobby Bar. The man who murdered her was said to have then checked in to the Menger Hotel in San Antonio three blocks away where he also disappeared without a trace.
