Diamond Ridge - Irish Creek - For years many of the local people have reported a noise in the woods. If you walk down a particular stretch of the road you can hear something walking with you. A very religious lady, not from the area, said it is the devil himself. She says he walks the ridge. This area has a unusual amount of murders and suicides reported in and near it.
