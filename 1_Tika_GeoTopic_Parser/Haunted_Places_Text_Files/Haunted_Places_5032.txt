Location: Screaming Bridge

Description:
It was reported that on Halloween night a woman was on her way home from picking up her baby after a Halloween party. She was dressed as a cat and had red contacts in. She was going around the curve right before the bridge and was tuning her radio when her car missed the curve and ran off the side of the bridge clearing through some trees and landing in the water below. The screaming bridge got its name because some people have heard a woman screaming when they were around the bridge. Other people have reported seeing her red, glowing eyes.
