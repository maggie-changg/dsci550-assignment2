Location: Hunters Lane

Description:
Only when two of the residents in the house fight the ghost will show her rage. Only a small cat was in the room at the time. A whole dresser fell down onto the bed with on it a television and inside it lots of clothes. Another, which the treadmill turned on by in self. She is older and a white lady. Very nice, but gets angry when people fight.
