Location: Overby's Furniture Store

Description:
It is said a ghost haunts the fourth floor of the old Overby's Furniture store (now a music store) at the corner of Vine and Broadway. According to accounts after the tornado of 1927 the Butler County Courthouse was destroyed and a temporary courtroom was established on the fourth floor of the building. It is rumored a woman in the jail cells in back of the same floor hanged herself and still walks that floor.
