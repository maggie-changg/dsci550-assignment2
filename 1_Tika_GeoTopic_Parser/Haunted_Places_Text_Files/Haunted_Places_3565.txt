Location: St. Louis Cathedral

Description:
Occasionally on early morning rain storms, the spirit of Pere Dagobert can be heard singing the "Kyrie". The voice travels from St. Lois Cathedral to St. Louis Cemetery #1. The procession was from a funeral mass He conducted in 1769 for a group of townspeople who led a rebellion against the Spanish occupation. They were executed for insurrection against the crown and their bodies were left to rot in Jackson Square as an example. Pere held a mass for them and had them buried to the delight of the townspeople.
