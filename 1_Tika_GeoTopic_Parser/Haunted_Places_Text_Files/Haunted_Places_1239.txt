Location: Penn State Berks

Description:
There was a suicide each year for the first seven years that the school had dorms. The school is located directly across from the Tulepehocken Bridge haunting you have listed in your site and is directly next to Reading which is said to be the most demonic place on the east coast and for awhile held the country's highest suicide rating. Students, including myself, have heard footsteps and unusual behavior such as, doors slamming, feelings of uneasiness and sightings of a male student who committed suicide on the campus.
