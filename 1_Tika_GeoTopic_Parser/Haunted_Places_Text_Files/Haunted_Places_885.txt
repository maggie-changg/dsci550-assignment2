Description:
The Hill School Chapel - The chapel was built in late 1800's as a gift from the alumni of the elite boarding school. The Chapel is built in a very dark Romanesque style. One of the first headmasters of the school, John Meigs supposedly suffered from severe depression and hung himselffrom a light in the chapel. Unable to be buried on sacred ground because of the cause of death the school's greatest headmaster is buried right outside the side doors of the chapel. Students who have snuck into the chapel late at night have reported to see the very same light which Meigs hung himself from sway back and forth. Also in the back of the chapel the stairway to the bell tower is littered with signatures of past alter boys and students. Noises such as screaming, bells ringing and Latin being spoken can sometimes be heard coming from the stairwell.
