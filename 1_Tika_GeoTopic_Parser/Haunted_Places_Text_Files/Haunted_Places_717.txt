Location: Gettysburg College

Description:
Stevens Hall - Haunted by the "The Blue Boy." About a hundred years ago, a young boy who was being abused at home sought refuge amongst the college women who lived here. One cold, snowy night, the headmistress came up to check on the girls so they hurriedly hid the boy outside on their window ledge. The headmistress took her time talking to the young women, but finally she went back to her room. The girls rushed to the window ledge only to find the boy was not there anymore! They went down & outside to see if he had fell, but there was no boy. To this day, sightings of a young boy, blue in the face as if frozen, are common among Stevens Hall residents.
