Location: The Dillinger House

Description:
This is a bed and breakfast place right now, a man hung himself there a LONG Time ago, and then his wife died a few days later and their kids were left to raise themselves...the man hung himself in the middle window on the top floor, He still haunts it. The shades in other rooms pull themselves down, and sometimes u can even see him there.......Its a Very "Evil" Place...go see for yourself. Cold chills will run down your spine over and over.
