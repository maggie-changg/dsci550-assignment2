Description:
In the 1800's, a 9 year-old girl was hit and killed by a train while playing on the tracks. Apparently she got lost while wandering in the woods. Her ghost has been seen by residents that live near the railroad tracks, as the girl, clothed in a white dress, still searches for her home.
