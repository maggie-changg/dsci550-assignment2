Location: Mackinac Bridge

Description:
Its been said to me that only sometimes when people go over the Mackinac Bridge you can here a little baby crying because the parents had gotten into a accident on the bridge and they went over the side of the bridge and they had a little baby in the car with them. - May 2008 Update â€“ There have been 2 accidents that are listed on Wikipedia 1 in 1989 @ 1 in 1997. Neither accident mentioned a baby. 5 Workers dies on the bridge during its construction. < href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackinac_Bridge ">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackinac_Bridge
