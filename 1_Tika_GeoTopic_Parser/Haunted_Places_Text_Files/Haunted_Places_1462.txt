Location: Lincoln Park

Description:
After the Park closed in 1986, it lay abandoned. Strange sounds, such as carnival-type music could be heard. The Park has been the site of many deaths over its 100-year history, including a worker who fell off the roller coaster in the mid 80's. Most buildings have since burned down.
