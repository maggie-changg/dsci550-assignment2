Location: Mack Cemetery

Description:
Follow Skyline Trail until you reach the town offices. In back of the building is a small family plot. In the far left corner next to a large tree lays a single stone. On the stone reads "IT". There are no names, dates or other information on the stone. Across the street stands a large abandoned house, the presence of evil vibes are felt through out the entire area, as though you are being watched.
