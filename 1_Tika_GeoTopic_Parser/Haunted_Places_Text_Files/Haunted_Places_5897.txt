Location: Old Alexander Middle School

Description:
An old janitor haunts the third floor with a little girl by his side. You can smell cigar smoke in the hall where he used to smoke every once in awhile. Hammers have been thrown and glasses have picked themselves up off the ground and shattered. People have seen shining lights in the middle of the night on the third floor windows, when the workers are all gone.
