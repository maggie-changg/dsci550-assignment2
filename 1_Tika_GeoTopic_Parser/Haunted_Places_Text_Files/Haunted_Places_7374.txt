Location: Wabash County State Forest

Description:
Near the Salamonie Reservoir, black shadows have been seen running through the forest. Strange lights also have been known to appear, along with a foul odor. Witnesses have even claimed to see wolf-like creatures wondering about the forest. Hikers say that time seems to stand still while hiking and the trails appear to shift, causing some unlucky people to be lost.
