Location: Old Sacred Heart Rectory

Description:
Was an old Rectory for a church but was them moved a few blocks away. Very strange feelings in the attic, always cold up there even in the summer. House is almost too calming when candles are lit, almost like someone hugging you from the inside. One night (The person who wrote this used to live there) there were coughing noises out in the hall, only would go away if you told them to, not out loud but in your mind. Saw people congregating in the living room very late one night. Found fingernail scratches underneath stairs after a psychic came over. When on computer in kitchen always heard someone coming in the room late at night.
