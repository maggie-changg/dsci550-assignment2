Location: Carl Road

Description:
If you drive down Carl Road and drive down until you see an orchard and get out of your car, you can feel a strange presence. If you go into the orchard and walk a little ways you'll hear leaves crunching behind you and when you look behind you, you'll see a white shadowy figure walking from one tree to another and then disappear. If you stay longer you can feel something pressing against you.
