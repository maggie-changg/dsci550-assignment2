Location: Grapevine Cemetery

Description:
There is a statue of an Angel in the Grapevine Cemetery and it is said that her eyes turn red and bleed and she cries for all the dead babies.There are two different versions of the story to the angel of grapevine cemetery. One is that at midnight on a full moon she will look up at you and her eyes will leak blood. My friends mother said she saw that about twenty years ago, the story of my generation goes as all my friends grew up within minutes of the cemetery, that her head has been broken off and sits atop her body and her right wing is broken off and laying in the ground. It is said that if you knock of her head that she will curse you with bad luck and you might die, however if you place her wing on her then she will give you one wish. There is another story of a grave there, I don't know which one but that you pull up in front of it and roll down all your windows open your trunk and doors and turn a love song up loud, because some guy committed suicide after his girlfriend left him, the ghost of a young teenager will scream a death roar and you have to get the trunk closed along with the doors and roll up the windows before he gets to your car or you will die.
