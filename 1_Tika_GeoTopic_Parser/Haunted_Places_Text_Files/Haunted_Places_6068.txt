Location: Mead Hotel

Description:
Downstairs in the Shanghai room. In the 1950's this room was used as a bar in which individuals would laugh, drink, and gamble. A female bartender was stabbed to death around 1953. Today, lights flicker, doors shut by themselves, and the smell of blood is evident within 20 feet of this room. The room is unusually cold.
