Location: Indian Falls

Description:
Back in the late 1900's (no specific date sorry) a women and her husband were traveling along the edge of the falls. And the husband fell in. It's claimed that she didn't want to live without him. She jumped in too. People have claimed that still today they can see that women and sometimes they see Red light or orbs floating around the spots she died. - Feuary 2005 Update: many people have drowned there but two in particular stand out. In the late 1950's two brothers were swimming at the bottom of the falls when one went out too far and started to sink. The other brother then jumped in to save him but unfortunately both drowned and are seen quite regularly by the staff of the Log cabin.
