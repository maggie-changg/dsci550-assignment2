Location: Upper Darby High School

Description:
There is a spirit haunting the Performing Arts Center Theatre which is said to be of a young boy who hanged himself because he was tormented by evil spirits which live in the attic of the theatre. Actors and theatre technicians there have witnessed a hanging body in the shadows and have encountered many strange things like moving boxes and hearing noises. Lamps in storage tend to smash for no reason.
