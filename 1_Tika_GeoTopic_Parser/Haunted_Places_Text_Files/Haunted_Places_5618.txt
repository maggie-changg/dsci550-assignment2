Location: The McGarrah Stagecoach Tavern Inn

Description:
The McGarrah Stagecoach Tavern Inn (Monroe, NY) was on Ghost Hunter (SCI-FI) program, and in Ghost Investigator Volume 6 (Dark Shadows) book by Linda Zimmermann and has had many ghosts sighting. The McGarrah Stagecoach Tavern Inn began its existence sometime between 1790 and 1800 and constitutes one of the oldest buildings in Monroe, N.Y. On of the common sightings is a man with top hat, dress in a dark suit wondering the rooms upstairs. A witness attempted to confront the ghost by running after him, but as he turned the corner, the ghostly man vanished. The man is described about 5ft, dress in a dark suit style in 1800 with top hot. You could hear his footstep as he walks back and forth on the second floor. The basement is truly a frightening experience. Every time we went down stars the temperature dropped at least 15 degrees. EMF went wild, as you get closer to the fireplace. As the hairs on the back of my neck reacted to chills, you can actually feel ghostly pressure surrounding you. The sounds of Ghostly footsteps wondering around have become a common occurrence at this inn. This house is truly haunted.
