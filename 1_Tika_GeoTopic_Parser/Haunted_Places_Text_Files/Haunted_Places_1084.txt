Location: The entire area

Description:
There are numerous hot spots in the whole of the valley from haunted houses, to a demon in the woods who has been felt by many and seen from the corner of the eye. A very menacing spirit he is. He resides in Loganton on top of a hill with a limestone face, in the woods. Never try to visit him alone.
