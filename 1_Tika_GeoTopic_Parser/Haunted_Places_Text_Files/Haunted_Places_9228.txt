Headless Statues - : There is a ghost by the name of E.T. Wickham who haunts the grounds at and around the headless statues. Strange noises and such have been heard near the cabin he used to live in across the street. The cabin still stands but is in ruin. The statues are all still standing but are in desperate need of repair. -  March 2007 update: The Statues are no longer there. They have been removed by relatives and family of Wickham.
