Description:
The ghost of Mrs. Smith is said to be seen on the widow's walk on moonlit nights. The house overlooks the Cumberland River where her husband was a Riverboat Captain. In life, she sat on the balcony overlooking the river waiting for him to come home. He died in an accident on the river, and never returned to her. She still stands in vigil, waiting for her husband to come home.
