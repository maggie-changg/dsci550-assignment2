Description:
Ann Arbor rd & Sheldon - Late at night when everyone is leaving the store after close, mysterious noises are heard coming from a back closet such as banging on the walls. They go back there and nothing abnormal is found. Legend has it that before the strip mall was built there was a house there and a little boys father trapped him in a small closet and left him there to starve. You can still hear him banging on the wall.
