Description:
Deanefield - During the Civil War, confederate soldiers hiding from the Yankees used a small cliff cave to hide out. It is said that the Yankees ambushed the southern soldiers, killing them all. On summer nights of the full moon, shots can be heard as well as sounds of laughter, a fire crackling, and horses galloping. The cliffs can be found off of highway 1414 in Ohio Co, Ky.
