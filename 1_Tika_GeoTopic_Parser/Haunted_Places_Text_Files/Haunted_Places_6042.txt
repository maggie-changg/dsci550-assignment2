Location: Lee Avenue

Description:
This street had so much activity that the neighbors were comparing stories that at night they experienced that beings were laying down on top of them as they turned in for the night. Also names of the children were written on the kitchen walls of several of the houses in magic marker. Nursery rhymes were heard being sung in one of the homes closets ... backwards talking was heard in the middle of the night then chairs would tip over without anyone being in them. It has left people so scared they moved away!
