Location: Woodland Cemetery

Description:
There is a tombstone in there that a young girl sits on. When she is sitting on her grave there is a glow to it at night. A college student spotted her while doing a report. He tried to talk to her but no response. She looks normal and clear like anybody else. She is wearing tennis shoes, a sweatshirt and jeans.
