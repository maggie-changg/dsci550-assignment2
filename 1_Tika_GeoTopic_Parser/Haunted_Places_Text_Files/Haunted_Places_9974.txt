Location: Shady Lawn Nursing Home

Description:
Formerly a mental facility, there have been many sightings and sounds blames on a ghost they call "Oscar". Oscar was a patient in the mental facility and before he died he swore to never leave and to make everyone's lives there hell. My fiance worked as a CMT (med-tech) there, she didn't believe in ghosts until Oscar made a bunch of noise and scared her out of the basement one night.
