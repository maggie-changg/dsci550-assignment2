Location: Bear Hill Road

Description:
this place is on Bear Hill road it is a very old house, most of the kids call it "the plague house" a long time ago people who were infected with the plague virus or any other virus that people couldn’t cure, they would leave them in that house to die. They took the bodies out in the woods and buried them deep so that animals wouldn’t get to them and spread the virus. soon after they took the bodies out, they too would die themselves and fall where ever they landed. Now you can see what everyone calls "the white ghost" it will come around only when you do, also how can you forget the painful moans and screams. - January 2007 Update: Private Property.
