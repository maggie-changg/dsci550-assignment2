Location: Paradise Road

Description:
Witnesses report feeling an eerie presence. They have heard inhuman screams, seen short, robed shapes in the woods, and have even seen a raccoon, decapitated, with blood glistening in the headlights, but no blood on the road and no head anywhere in sight. Location is on Paradise Road, a right turn shortly after you pass Saint Colletta's. Advice is to STAY OUT OF THE WOODS ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE.
