Location: Old Railroad Tracks

Description:
It is said that a bus full of children that died on this set of tracks was hit by an oncoming train. If you stop and cut your car off on top of the tracks, the dead children will push your car across the tracks. There are people that have placed baby powder on the car's bumper later to find children's handprints, when there was nothing around.
