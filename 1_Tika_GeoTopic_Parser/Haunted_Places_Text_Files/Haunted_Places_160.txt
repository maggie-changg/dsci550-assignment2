Location: Elementary school

Description:
building used to be a graveyard, all bodies not removed. A creepy man wondering the halls, but only in dark and deserted places. Behind stage, cold spots galore, and the curtain wires moving with no one by them. Old band room, and hole in the ceiling, and once on a while a student will see a mans face through it.
