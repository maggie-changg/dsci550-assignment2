Location: New Bedford High School

Description:
Built in the 1970's the high school has been home to a few deaths. When the school was being built, it is said that a man fell to his death between Blue House and the Core of the school. It is also said that someone was shot/or stabbed in the section of the school known as D-Block. A few classes have also experienced seeing the sinks in the bio lab rooms turning on all by them self's. Also at after school has ended and most of the teachers have left, you feel like someone is watching you. There have also been a few occasions when people report their lockers slamming shut all by themselves. In early 2007 a Janitor died on the grounds while he was shoveling snow and a teacher also died halfway though the school year.
