Description:
West Campus - Las Casas Dorms - In spring of 2007, residents living in this room have witnessed random items falling off of shelves and objects moving. One resident experienced a wide open door slam shut in front of her, and no one else was in the room with her. Another student, almost asleep, was startled when her bed started to shake uncontrollably for unknown reasons. An additional roommate reported her name being called from the kitchen when other roommates were away on break.
