Location: Old Town Pizza Company

Description:
The place of an old pizza parlor, still in business. It is very eerie and not very welcoming. The lights are dark and the atmosphere is spooky. The basement is said to be haunted by someone. There have been reports of things moving and things being replaced. Many of the workers won't go downstairs because of eerie feeling. Said to be a spirit who lurks around downstairs. - October 20007 Correction: Nina is associated with the Old Town Pizza. There is a brick in the back room with Nina inscribed and there is even a portrait of Nina in that same room. Tourist can actually sit in that back room to enjoy their pizza. The story is actually told on a city of Portland Tour called the Dark Side of Portland Walking Tour.
