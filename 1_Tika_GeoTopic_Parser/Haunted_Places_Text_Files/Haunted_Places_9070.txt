Location: Ale House Pub and Eatery

Description:
There has been numerous sightings and mischief here. beer mug's go sailing across the room, food plates being flipped up for no apparent reason. Customer's getting hit with thing's, one so bad that he files a lawsuit against the pub stating they were responsible for his injuries (of course it was thrown out). - July 2005 Update: The Pub was torn down a few years ago and now has a book store and strip mall on the site.
