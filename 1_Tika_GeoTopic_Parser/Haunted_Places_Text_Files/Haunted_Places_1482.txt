Location: High Hill Theater

Description:
Supposedly the caretakers of the theater and mansion house located near by all killed themselves mysteriously one night. One girl killed herself on the second floor in the mansion and you can see her ghost and in the theater and caretaker house further back into the woods you can hear noises of people screaming and twigs snapping like someone is walking in the woods nearby. Along with the "creepy feeling" you get when you visit this place you can also see a blood message written by one of the people who slit their wrists and wrote on the inside of the house "my way in" and on the outside "is also my way out" The town is currently renovated this site so that the theater may be opened to the public soon again.
