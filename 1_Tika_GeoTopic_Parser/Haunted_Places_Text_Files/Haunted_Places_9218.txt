Location: Chapel Hill Light

Description:
There is a railroad crossing where many people have reported a strange, unexplainable light on the tracks. Supposedly a railroad worker was killed, becoming decapitated, many years ago. The light is said to be him swinging a lantern looking for his head. Police don't allow people to park around the tracks anymore though, you will need permission to visit.
