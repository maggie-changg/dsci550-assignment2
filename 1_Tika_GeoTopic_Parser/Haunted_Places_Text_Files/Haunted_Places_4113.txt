Location: Zaleski State Forest

Description:
On a remote backpacking loop in the Zaleski State Forest, hikers have reported seeing what appears to be a swinging lantern at night along an abandoned stretch of train tracks, in an area formerly known as Moonville.  Legend has it that the lantern is carried by the ghost of a man who got hit by a train there.  The lantern has also been spotted in an adjacent train tunnel.
