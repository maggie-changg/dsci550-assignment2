Location: Sweetwater Plantation

Description:
Music is played occasionally on an old piano that sits in the parlor where guests were entertained by a former Governor, back in the late 1800's. The caretaker recalls a light being turned on at night on the second floor and faucets being turned on at night when she is trying to sleep.
