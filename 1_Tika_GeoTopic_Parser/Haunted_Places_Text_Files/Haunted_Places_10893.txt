She was raped and murdered one night. A friend of hers stumbled upon the murder and was also killed. The house is now a bed and breakfast. There have been several haunting incidences, including a sighting of a girl in a flapper dress. Footsteps have been heard and seen on the squeaky steps. www.lumberbaron.com
