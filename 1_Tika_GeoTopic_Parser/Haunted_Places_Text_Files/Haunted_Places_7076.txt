Location: Campground cemetery

Description:
Campground cemetery is a small cemetery located adjacent to a well traveled highway (Lake Road)at the corner of lake paradise road, a few miles southwest of Mattoon, Coles county, IL. Local legend says that on some days, people have passed the cemetery and have seen picnickers in the there dressed in clothing from the late 1800's or early 1900's. When they look back a few seconds later, no one is in the graveyard. Strange lights have been seen coming from the area, and when people have called the Sheriff's department to report vandals, no one has been found.
