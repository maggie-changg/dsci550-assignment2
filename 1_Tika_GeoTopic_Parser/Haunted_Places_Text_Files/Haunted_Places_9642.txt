Location: Across From Paper Mill

Description:
Swing outside swings by itself at times when there is no wind. if your in a car your radio comes on by itself, the windows go crazy and your car dies. sometimes if you look at the window you’ll see a girl put her hand on the window and it’ll start bleeding and spell out help.. sometimes you see the murderer with his axe walking around.
