Location: Benedictine University

Description:
Cemetary - A few years ago kids would party out in the cemetary. One night they decided to take a Ouija board out there to contact any spirits, just for the fun of it. One of the boys involved with the board began convulsing and screaming different languages. Public safety was called to the scene, but were unable to control the boy. Shortly following, the monks from the Abbey across the street showed up and declared the boy possessed. The boy was taken to the fifth floor in Benedictine Hall (which is no longer acessable to students) and an exorcism was performed.
