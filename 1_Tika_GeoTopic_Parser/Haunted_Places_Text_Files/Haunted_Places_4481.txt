Location: Sketch Club Community Theater

Description:
Voices of children can sometimes be heard in this 100 year old + former schoolhouse. Also the occassional apparition of an older woman (a teacher perhaps) can be seen in the dressing room areas. Hosts of orbs appear in photos, also with whispy swirls of mist. Theater WILL allow investigations sometimes.
