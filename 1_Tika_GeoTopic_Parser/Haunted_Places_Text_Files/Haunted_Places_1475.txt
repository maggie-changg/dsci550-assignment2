Location: Millicent Library

Description:
Basement & Vaults - The hat of Heddy Green (a stingy old woman and mother to Colonel Green) lies within the vaults of the basement and some claim to have seen her after touching the hat. Some librarians will talk freely about the hauntings and offer information but most deny any and all accusations of paranormal activity. Itâ€™s a great place to visit. Don't bother taking pictures. They usually won't develop correctly.
