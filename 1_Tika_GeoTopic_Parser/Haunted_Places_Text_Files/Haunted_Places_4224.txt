Description:
A woman committed suicide in the summit bar and grill many years ago. When the bar and grill is closed up at night she moves things around. The camera in the pool area often picked up ripples in the water when no one was up there. She knocks on the penthouse doors in the middle of the night and her image is often picked up in pictures. Reports of feeling "hands on one's back. Knocks on the penthouse doors in the middle of the night and a woman's image is often picked up in pictures. My father showed me some promotional pamphlets of the hotel and in every single one you can see a woman's facial outline and features in the pictures. Even more eerie is the window she had jumped from.
