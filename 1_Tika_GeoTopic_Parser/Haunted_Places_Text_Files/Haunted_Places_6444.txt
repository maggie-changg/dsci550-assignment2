Location: Holland Road

Description:
Once there was a little girl(in 1937) that went strolling on her black horse at 11:00-12:00(around then)a drunk driver came speeding down the corner and hit her and her horse. Then the drunk driver called his friends to have them pick her up and bury her. Then a couple weeks later the drunk driver wouldn’t admit he killed her. Then a couple days later he died(no one knows how he died)and after her parents died they sold her house to a old lady. The old lady recorded in a journal what had happened every night. The little girl and her horse haunted her every night and told the old lady "GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! " the old lady didn’t move out of the house. The old lady died and the cops couldn’t figure out how she died. Then the cops found her journal and found out that Holland road is haunted(After the old lady died they tore down the house and the barn with the horses being dead).Some people went down the road and had herd the horses trotting and eating. Some people say they have seen the little girl(She has black hair)in fog with a bright light! And when people freak out she gets mad and she messes with you!
