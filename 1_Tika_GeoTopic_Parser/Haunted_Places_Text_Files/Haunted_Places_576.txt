Description:
This restaurant used to be a private residence that was built in the 1700's. There are 3 floors in the building, but tourists are only allowed on the first two. Employees of the restaurant have reported everything being moved around when they come to work in the morning. On the second floor, if you stand by the steps to the third floor, you can hear whistling. There are even documented photos of the ghosts.
