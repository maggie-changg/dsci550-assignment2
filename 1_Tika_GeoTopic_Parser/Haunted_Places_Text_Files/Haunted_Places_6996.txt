Location: Park Jr. High

Description:
The school used to be a nunnery in the 1950's. It was rumored that a nun killed herself in one of the upper floors in the building. Now she haunts the room (room number cannot be found). Students found erasers missing, felt chills around the room, and heard voices in the absence of the teacher.
