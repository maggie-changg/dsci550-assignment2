Location: Arby's

Description:
Employees that go into the basement feel like they are being watched. Several employees have heard children laughing after hours, have seen shadows, backed up in to something large but nothing is there, and had their hair pulled in the basement. A bald man has been seen upstairs in the kitchen staring at the oven when only employees were in the store and plants have been seen swinging in the dining room when there is no air circulating.
