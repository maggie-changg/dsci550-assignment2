Description:
There said to be a ghost that haunts the park at night. One foggy night, in the Oakland hills, a woman crossed the street and got hit by a truck. She died and her spirit did not rest. This very day, she haunts the park. Rumor is that the park made the spirit a hut and a model house. When it gets dark, people had reports that they had seen a ghost.
