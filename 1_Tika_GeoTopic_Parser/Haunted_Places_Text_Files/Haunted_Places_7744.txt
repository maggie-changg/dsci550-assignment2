Location: The Haunted Railroad Bridge

Description:
During the late 1800's, a fire occurred on the original railroad trestle. A train with passenger cars was involved and eight people died, including a boy and his father. The old wooden bridge was replaced with a steel structure on the original concrete footings. The bridge spans the White River and Route 14 in West Hartford. There have been numerous sightings of a little boy ghost playing in the river. Many people have even reported smelling fire in the area of the old bridge.
