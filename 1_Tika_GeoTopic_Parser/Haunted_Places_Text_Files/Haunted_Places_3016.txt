Description:
It was said that a high school graduate from Hayden High School in 1988-1989, was going to be a cheerleader for the Phoenix Cardinals. But she got caught with marijuana and thought she was going to lose her spot as a cheerleader. So she got a gun and committed suicide. There was a sighting in about 1998 or 1999. Hayden's softball team had a tournament, and one of the teams stayed in the Jr. High gym. They said that at about 12:00AM, they saw a young girl dressed in a cheerleader uniform, doing a routine. As soon she was done, she disappeared. There is also another story of a man who lost his life on the football field. While he was running the ball, he got tackled, broke his neck, and died instantly. It is said that on some nights, you will see a football player running the ball. Heâ€™ll fall and then disappear from the football field.
