Location: Marquette University

Description:
Mashuda Hall - In one of the dorms, a girl apparently committed suicide in one of the rooms years ago, and residents who lived in the room afterwards reported poltergeist activity: sounds, flying objects, and writing on the fogged-up window. However, a priest blessed the room and performed some kind of exorcism, and the activity ceased, and hasn't returned since.
