Location: La Paz

Description:
UFW headquarters/children's hospital - the swings swing of their own accord. There is blood in the bathrooms of the old hospital section (it was once a children's hospital). The feeling of death and what it has left behind is inundating...and you can hear voices. walking past a door that is shut off to the back building that is unused, a witness heard a banging on the door. The doorknob turned.
