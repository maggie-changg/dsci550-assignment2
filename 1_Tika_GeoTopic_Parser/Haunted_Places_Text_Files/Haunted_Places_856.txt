Description:
The building is quite old and is a two building hotel. One building is the main building which contains the kitchen and lobby and lounge as well as two floors of guest rooms.  The other building is laundry and two floors of rooms as well as a floor of apartments.  In the main building there have been instances of apparitions in the kitchen and also on the second floor when walking down the hallway if you look in the big window at the end you can sometimes see someone behind you and when you turn around no one is there, but when you turn back towards the window they are there again.  Also, one particular instance was in the kitchen were a radio was playing and when the security guard turned it off and walked away it came back on.....then he turned it off again and it came back on when he turned it off again and heard the radio playing he went back but the radio was not on and it was playing music.  Also, the other building contains several spirits that have been seen and when you walk through the doors of the building you instantly sense a presence...you can often hear doors open and close, lights turn on and off on their own, and footsteps behind you.  Also, when you walk through the halls you can hear loud thumps on the door beside you and the room will be vacant.
