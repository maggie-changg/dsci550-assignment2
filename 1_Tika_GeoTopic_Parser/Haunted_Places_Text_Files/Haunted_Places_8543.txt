Description:
In the early 1980's some student's were in the auditorium practicing for a school play and they say that there was some students on the top balcony put up ornaments for the play, it is said that, that after everyone one left one student stayed there and later that night killed him self by hanging him self from the top balcony. The next days where really hard on the school and under the auditorium are some what big tunnels students have been caught there skipping, about 2 weeks after that death some kids were skipping and got caught instead of stopping when told the ran into the tunnels going deeper in them, so they waited and waited for them to come out but they didn't, finally they went in after them when they found the students they were found dead with the throats cut back all the to where the knife hit the bone, police went in there trying to find the murder but then they found that there's a dead end at that the end of the tunnel and if someone in there would of wanted to get out they would of had to come out by the front. What killed them who knows? Many students hear the kids that die screaming, "HELP" and "PLEASE DONT KILL ME".
