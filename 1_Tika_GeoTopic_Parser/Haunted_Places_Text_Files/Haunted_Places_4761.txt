Location: Railroad Tracks

Description:
You can stand on the tracks and stare back to the west on the tracks and a bright light will appear and it seems to be coming down the track. You can walk down the tracks and the light will go out and when you turn around it will be behind you. The story is a man was run over on the tracks years ago and his head was severed and he is back with a lantern looking for his head.
