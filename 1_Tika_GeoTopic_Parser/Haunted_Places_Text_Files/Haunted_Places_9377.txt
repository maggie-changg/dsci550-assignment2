Location: Copper Ridge Baptist Church

Description:
Reports of seeing black figures, moving around inside, and you can hear screams up at the old barn, about 75- 100 yards away from the church. Once a group of boys went in with a tape recorder, and left it inside, while they remained outside. On the way home they listened to the recorder, and you can distinctly hear a little girl say " help us." The boys went back and put the tape recorder in the church, overnight. Upon there return, and listening to the tape, you can hear all kinds of things moving around all night, and after the tape had been running for about 15 minutes, you can hear footsteps come up to the recorder and turn it off. - October 2007 Update â€“ The Church has been demolished.
