Description:
the oldest house in Metuchen, it was originally an inn during Revolutionary War times. The house is haunted by a Revolutionary War soldier who can be sometimes seen hanging between floors (legend has it that he hung himself). Also seen is the ghost of a woman (the innkeeper's wife) searching for her son, who was kidnapped by Indians when he was 10 years old. Psychics/mediums have detected the presence of several other ghosts, also.
