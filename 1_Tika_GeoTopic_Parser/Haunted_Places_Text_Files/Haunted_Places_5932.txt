Location: Goosehill Cemetery

Description:
The cemetery on the top of Goosehill is from the 1800-early 1900's. Very small (about 30 graves or so) surrounded by woods on top of a steep hill, many have witnessed strange dark shadows walking around, and unexplained voices from the woods surrounding it.
