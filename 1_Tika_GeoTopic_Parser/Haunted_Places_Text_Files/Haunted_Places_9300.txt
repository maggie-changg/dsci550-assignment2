Description:
Old Library - If you go to the old library building and enter the stacks there, you might see the ghost of a former librarian. She worked there about 20 years ago and finally retired, but would go just to help put the books back in place, she had a heart attack and died down there. Whenever people were down there, they said they felt like they were being watched, and when they pulled material and left for a minute they'd come back and it was put up, thatâ€™s not strange except they were down there by themselves. She appeared to one of the workers and she swore she'd never go down there again.
