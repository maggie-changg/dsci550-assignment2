Location: Gootleburg Cemetery

Description:
Strange mists and fogs hover above this sinister cemetery. In the late 1800's, a doctor who performed abortions is said to have buried the fetuses of aborted babies in a shallow grave of about 2 feet. He is also believed to have buried some of the unlucky mothers who did not survive the abortion. Dogs started bringing home bones around that time period, and body parts would be caught on fishing lines in the nearby pond. Babies have even been reported crawling around at night. At the tree where the doctor hanged himself on top of the hill, you can sometimes see an apparition. - February 2007 Correction: The crawling babies has not be witnessed by the investigator submitting the correction. The fog does seem to hit this particular cemetery in a off way. People claim they hit a large black dog, and it does significant damage to their vehicles but no animal is ever found. a large black dog running on the above hill has been seen many times. It is believed this is not a living creature. Also the pond that is behind and to the right a bit from the cemetery was not where they had trouble with most of the bones and body parts. It was an extension stream that leads into the neighboring creek that most of the problems occurred. There is also a man who strolls up and down the road daily in 1920's attire, combing his hair. Warning:The cemetery has been badly vandalized and there isn't a single stone that isn't in pieces. Police patrol it pretty steadily.
