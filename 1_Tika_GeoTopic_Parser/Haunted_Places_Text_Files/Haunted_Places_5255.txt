Location: The Piano House

Description:
In the late 1800's, during a family well-digging get together, after the new well was dug, a pregnant woman fell into the old well, and despite efforts of many men, she was never retrieved and died. Now you can see her in a bloody white nightgown, standing in the bedroom window of the house. It is also said that the piano moves from room to room on its own.
