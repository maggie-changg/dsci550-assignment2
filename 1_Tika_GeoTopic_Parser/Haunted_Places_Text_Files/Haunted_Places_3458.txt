Location: Clark Middle School

Description:
This is an old school that is haunted by a woman in a white dress. She'll play with instruments in the band room, appear in empty hallways in the summer, and turn classroom lights off. She's not known to harm people, just to scare them. Most of the teachers tell the students there is a female ghost that comes up through the floors. Other teachers say there's no ghost, and itâ€™s all hocus pocus.
