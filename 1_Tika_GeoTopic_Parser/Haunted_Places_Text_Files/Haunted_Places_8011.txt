Years ago at the location of the park there was a battle of confusion between Indians and pioneers. There is a memorial there for all the life's that were lost. Many things happen there. If you go up at night some have said that they see shadow's running around them. A few accounts say that there is a arch way of tree's that are almost like a spiritual pathway people that have walked thru the pathway say that instantly they hear screams and smell horrible horrible smell's.
