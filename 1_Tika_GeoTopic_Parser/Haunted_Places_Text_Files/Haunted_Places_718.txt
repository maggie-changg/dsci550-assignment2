Description:
Sigma Nu Fraternity House - This house was previously owned by the only doctor in the county through the depression era. He died in the house. There have been numerous incidents of lights going on and off, with nobody visable at the switches. Large, very heavy oak doors have slammed open and shut, followed by lights completely dimming out. The lights have dimmed out in the bedroom where the doctor died, while the lights in the hallway have stayed lit, and they're both on the same circuit. Sounds of things being thrown around in the basement in the dark, but the noise stops when the lights are turned on, and nothing is out of place. Once during a storm over a break, one of two people in the house heard the front door slam open, they went downstairs, closed the door, only to turn around and see wet footsteps on the carpet. Noises of walking upstairs were then heard. The person raced upstairs to find more wet footprints. The person chased the noised and footprints through the house. As the person chased the noised through the only hallway on the 3rd floor, when the other person was studying in the hallway, the studying person said that nobody had passed by, yet they both then heard the noises going down the stairs. They then heard the front door slam open again, and the footprints had exited the house. Another person was closing one of the heavy doors late one night when in mid swing, the door suddenly stopped dead, as if it had hit a solid obstacle. There was no obstruction, and the door could not have caught on anything. They swung the door again, and it then swung freely.
