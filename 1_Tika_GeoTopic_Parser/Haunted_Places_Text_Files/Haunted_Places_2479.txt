Location: Hilltop Road

Description:
You can hear screams at night, children crying, and playing. Allegedly A sailor Came home from seas crazy and killed his wife, son, and daughter. When near the property you feel chills and a sense of dread. The house burnt down a few years back but the haunting is still there. All you can see now is the chimney standing in the middle of the fenced in yard.
