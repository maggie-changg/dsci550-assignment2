Location: Orange Park

Description:
The Sports Authority - the phone extension in the Footwear department will ring. This is not an outside phone line. Other times, the store alarm will sound. The manager on duty and the police will be called to the store. This happens often and it is usually due to the motion sensor from over in the Footwear /Team Sports area. The police will search the store and find all is secure. Other times, we will leave the store neat and tidy and return the next morning to find an entire shelf of sport bags from the Team Sports area all over the floor.
