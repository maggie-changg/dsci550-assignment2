Location: Haunted Rocky Shore

Description:
A haunted rocky shore line. A young female ghost appears almost every night at sundown. She walks across the rocky shoreline barefooted in a bright white evening dress. Legend has it that her love sailed out to the lake at dusk, and she went out to look for him. He never came home. - June 2008 Update: It's a remote section of Reno Beach. To get to it, you have to park in the last lot and walk over a short bridge and go through a path in the wooded areas. On the left side of the path you'll see the refinery, and on the right is a section of rocky ledges that lead down to a flat area about 7X8ft. At times you can see the woman in white, but we've also observed a young boy (about 6 or 7 years old) who tends to follow you on the water though the woods and over the bridge. He seems friendly, and smiles so it's almost like he's trying to play with you. He stops at the waters edge by the bridge though, looking forlorn like he can't pass there.
