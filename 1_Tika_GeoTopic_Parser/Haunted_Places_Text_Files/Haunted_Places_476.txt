Location: Barn Sledding

Description:
There is a guy who owns that sledding hill. Back in the 1980s he was sledding down the hill, fell down and broke his neck. People say that at night after when everyone is gone, the guy comes out and walks up and down the hill to make sure everyone is leaving. It is also heard that he drives a white van.
