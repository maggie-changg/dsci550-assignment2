Location: The Grand Theatre

Description:
Haunted by the old janitor that ran the place a long time ago. When it was up and running as a theatre, employees would report lights turning on and off and garbage being cleaned up and no one had cleaned up. There also might be someone buried the basement according to stories. This information was printed in a story in the Grand Haven tribune around 1995. The theatre is currently going to be turned into a hotel if all goes well.
