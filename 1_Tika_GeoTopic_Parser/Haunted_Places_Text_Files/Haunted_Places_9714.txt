Location: Leon County Jail

Description:
The new Leon County Jail was constructed in the early 1990's. It was built on the same location that the old jail was built. (Ted Bundy was housed there for some time.) According to locals, the site it is built on is an air field. Corrections Officers and medical staff claim to have seen a woman in period clothing walking the halls crying, late at night, in the medical department. Also shadows seen and the feeling of not being alone.
