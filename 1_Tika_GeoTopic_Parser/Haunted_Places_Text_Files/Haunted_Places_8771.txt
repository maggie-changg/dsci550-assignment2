Location: Harby Jr. High

Description:
This place is teeming with weird things. During the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, some bodies were buried where the school was built. Teachers have reported seeing the faces of people in windows. Also showers in the locker rooms will turn on without anyone in the locker room.
