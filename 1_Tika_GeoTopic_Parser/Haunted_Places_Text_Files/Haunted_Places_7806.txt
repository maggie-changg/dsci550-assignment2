Location: Little Choo Choo Daycare

Description:
The daycare was closed because of a teacher who committed suicide and a little boy who was killed getting dragged underneath the tracks of the toy train. Some people said usually at night or sometimes in the day there is a presence of a little boy digging with his shovel in the ground. Nobody knows who he is, but sometimes he appears out of nowhere and some said at night a black woman can been seen trespassing and disappearing out of thin air.
