Location: Bachelor's Grove Cemetery

Description:
Over the years people claim to have spotted glowing lights, phantom cars, and over 100 ghosts. The Ghost Research Society had seen a young woman dressed in old-fashioned clothes and perched on a tombstone on August 10,1991. But even though she seemed to be almost transparent, a camera caught her image pretty clearly. If she was a ghost that picture will prove that ghost are real to people don't believe in them.
