Location: Overland station

Description:
Former ATSF train station reportedly haunted by at least three entities: One is a woman occasionally seen dressed in early 20th century apparel on the second floor of the station, another sighting is of a former ticket-clerk who is often seen at "his" ticket booth, and a small boy, possibly ten years old often appears in pictures taken outside the building, as well as in reflections in the windows of the station.
