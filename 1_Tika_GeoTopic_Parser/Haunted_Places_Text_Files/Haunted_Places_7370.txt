Location: Purple Head Bridge

Description:
One story is there is an old one lane toll bridge that cross the Wabash river on the outskirts (south 6th road) to saint Francesville IL. It is said that long ago it was a place where a man jumped from the bridge to hang his self. When he did his head ripped off, and was never found. If you go there on a raining night and park on the bridge and wait you WILL SEE a purple head floating toward you. The other is the bridge is supposedly a bridge they hung people off of in the 1800s, giving it its name purple head. Vincennes University legend has it that if you go out there you will hear screams from the spirits that have been hung.
