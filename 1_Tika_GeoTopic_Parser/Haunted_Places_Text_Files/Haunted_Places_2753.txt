Location: Birmingham High School

Description:
Before a high school, Birmingham High School, named after General Birmingham, was a World War II hospital for amputees and other injured soldiers. Many soldiers died during their stay at the hospital. After WWII, the hospital was renovated into present day Birmingham High School. At night you can hear rusty squeaking noises on while standing on the quad. Strange feelings of another presence can also be felt along the front steps of the Performing Arts Building and the in the front entrance area.
