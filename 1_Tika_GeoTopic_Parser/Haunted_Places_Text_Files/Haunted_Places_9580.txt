Location: The Herlong Mansion

Description:
Inez was the oldest of 6 siblings. They fought for 20 some odd years over the house after their mother passed away. The day Inez took possession of the house she had a diabetic seizure and died possibly in her childhood bedroom. That room remains haunted. The Herlong Mansion is now a bed & breakfast and has been investigated by professional ghost hunters.
