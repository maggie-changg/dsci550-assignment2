Description:
John C. West Hall -  An apparition of a torso of a young girl accompanied by electrical problems, TVs and lights shutting off. The dorm complex (several buildings) is now connected by partially underground tunnels to a dinning center (Wilkerson). - October 2007 Update/Additional Information: The story is that during a cold North Dakota night, a girl tried to take a short cut across a parking lot only to find that the door to the dorm was locked. It is said she froze to death outside the dorm. The tunnel system was later built and connected to the door near where she died. At the time of the incident there were no tunnels.
