Location: Hwy 1

Description:
It's said to be one of the most haunted places on the island. When they built H-1 digging through the mountain the worker's would see old Hawaiian worriers and would they would scare the workers off. Bones of the old Hawaiian were also found in the mountain. It took over 7 years to build H-1 because they couldn't find workers the Hawaiian people refused to dig any more. It's said that when you go through the tunnel you can hear the cries of the old Hawaiians.
