Location: Old Ridgeland Baptist Church

Description:
During the Civil War this church would hide injured soldiers from both sides of the war. To mask the moans and groans coming from upstairs, the Preacher would play the Wind Organ loudly. In the cemetery there are many bodies buried from the war. It is said you can hear the organ playing and the moans and groans from soldiers. It has been said that you can see someone(s) on the second floor. The area around the church, in the cemetery mainly is cooler than other areas. -  June 2005 Update / WARNING: Richland Baptist Church is on the National Register of Historic Places and is protected by the Richland Restoration League, Inc.
