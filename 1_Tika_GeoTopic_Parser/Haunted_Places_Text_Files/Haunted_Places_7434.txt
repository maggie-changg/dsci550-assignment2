Location: Pocahontas Parkway Rt. 895

Description:
Pocahontas Parkway was built where Indians once lived, hunted, and fished. Now there is a huge road there instead and they arenâ€™t happy. Nightly you can hear them, drumming, chanting, whooping, and talking in foreign tongue. And occasionally you can see them.
