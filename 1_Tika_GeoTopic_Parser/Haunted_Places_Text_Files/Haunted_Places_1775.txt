Location: Aspen St. and surrounding streets and Aspen St. Cemetery

Description:
The whole are has been know to be haunted, corner of Dale and Aspen is one sight, often seen is a grayish hue of a woman standing over you, doors slam, voices are heard and the feeling of a presence is there, very much there. One report was of a 13 yr old girl who was sleeping and a black shadowed image laid with her every night, the doors to locked closets were unlocked in the morning, laughing and bluish white lights where seen atop of the stairs to the sleeping quarters, beds slammed continuously, heavy breathing and nightmares were constant, the feeling of being watched from the stair way was noted to. The cemetery which is across the street has a spot where people walk or hike by the water, orbs/ streaks of lights were seen in pictures that resembled that of a man walking with a stick, there have been many sightings in that area when homes were condemned due to the drug and poverty of the area many of the homes were boarded up from Dale St. Aspen ct. Vigent to Pleasant St. many people wrote ghosts live here on the boarded up windows, the whole area was under some very evil paranormal activity, severely evil and with out a doubt in my mind paranormal activity existed, note the house on the corner of Dale and Aspen also had a report of a girl lying in bed trying to sleep when in a womanâ€™s voice she heard.. "shh go to sleep " in her ear.
