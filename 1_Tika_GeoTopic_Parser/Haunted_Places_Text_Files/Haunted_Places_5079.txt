Location: Ghost Bridge

Description:
There are several stories that go with this bridge, but only one can be verified of a soldier killing his wife on the bridge and throwing her below to the water back in the 1960's. One story goes that on certain night you can see her decomposing body walking the area under the bridge and another says on top of the bridge. Also it is said that if you turn your car off on the bridge it will not start again unless you push it off the bridge or till morning.
