Location: San Miguel Mission

Description:
It has been said and even that a woman, 2 men and 2 children haunt the chapel of the mission. Apparently they went there to hide from men who were drunk and attempting to rob and murder them. Unfortunately they did not get away, and were indeed murdered. They have been said to relive the incident often.
