Location: The Cadillac Bar

Description:
The ghost of an old owner is seen in the storage basement of the building and there is another ghost named "Beatrice", who was a former employee. She is a "negative spirit" because she was very unhappy and not pretty when she was alive. She turns on sinks and throws kitchen utensils. Many employees have seen both ghosts.
