Location: Podunk

Description:
Podunk is an old town right by Bargersville. It's a really weird and freaky place that near-city teens go to. There's a bridge that if you drive on to & then stop & turn off your headlights, radio, and don't talk then you can see a baby crawl across the road. You can also hear it crying or laughing sometimes.
