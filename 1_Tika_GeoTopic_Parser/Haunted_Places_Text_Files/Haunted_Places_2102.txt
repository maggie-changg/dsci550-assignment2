Location: Gurdon Railroad Tracks

Description:
If you walk down the tracks late at night, you will see a green light down the track. They say there was a man that was walking on them, and one day had got stuck in them. A train had cut his head off, and ever since then, you can see a light that looks like a lantern going down the tack. He is looking for his head. It was on “Unsolved Mysteries”.
