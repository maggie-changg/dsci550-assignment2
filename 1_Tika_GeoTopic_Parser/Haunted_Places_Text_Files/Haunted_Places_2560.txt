Location: Linda Vista Hospital

Description:
Old abandoned hospital across from Hollenbeck park on Chicago St. People who go there have reported seeing lights and hearing a little girl laughing and playing around in there. Screams, cold spats, noises, cries, moaning, lights coming on and off, noises could even be heard from the street at night with no one inside. Hospital is sometimes used for filming by production companies. A doctor has been seen on the main building, corner window, top floor looking out through the window. He was wearing a doctor's suit and a tie. Lights go on and off throughout the whole building. There is a room full of cages and a group of people claimed seeing a mentally ill patient(ghost) roaming inside a cage in that room. Strange noises are heard around the buildings. Cold and warm spots are felt in certain places.
