Location: Murrell

Description:
All Saint's Episcopal Cemetery - Alice of the Hermitage is buried here.  A flat gravestone with just the name ALICE is located beneath a huge oak.  Legend has it if you walk around her grave 13 times backwards and call her name twice she will come out over the old brick wall at the back of the cemetery. She is looking for her engagement ring that was lost in a creek. It is said women can feel her tugging on their wedding rings when they visit her grave.  She can also be caught on film.  Also you can smell strong, sweet flowers in the cemetery, when there are no flower shrubs only green bushes.  The cemetery is located off of 501, take a right at Martin Luther king Rd. the right at the stop sign.  You will come to a four way stop, take a right and the cemetery is on the left.
