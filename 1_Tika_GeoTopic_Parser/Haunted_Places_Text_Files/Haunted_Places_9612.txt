Location: Miller Sellen

Description:
Its an old historic house from the early 1900's. A former employee states People that had worked there for awhile would talk of strange noises like someone running though the hallways when no one was there. One employee got a call from an inside line only to hear static and a sound of a little girl playing on the phone. Problem was everybody was out to lunch.
