Location: Marquette University

Description:
Johnston Hall -  which was the first building erected on the campus, a Jesuit priest (or it might have been two) threw themselves off the top floor, or the roof, and their spirits still haunt the building. Witnesses often get strange feelings whenever walking down a hall alone.
