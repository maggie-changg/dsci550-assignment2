Location: Sullivan East High school

Description:
A long time ago back in the 80's a young girl hid from the teachers in the janitors closet. The janitor raped and murdered her. He put her in the cafeteria salad bar. Now to this day everyday the lunch ladies fix salads they can hear that girl screaming for help in a low deep voice.
