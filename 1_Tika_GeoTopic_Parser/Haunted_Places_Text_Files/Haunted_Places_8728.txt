Location: Rainbow Lake/Creek

Description:
The whole Rainbow Lake area has been plagued with rumors of witchcraft, cult activity, and peeping Tom's. Some homes that back up to the Rainbow Lake area have reported seeing paranormal figures, hearing shrieks during the night, and cold spots in the heat of summer. Rumors of a dead body being found further upstream in the Rainbow Creek area have also turned up as well as a sighting of a ghost-like male deeper into the woods. A few graves have also been found in the area, some marked with simple wooden crosses while others remain unmarked. - March 2008 Update: This location dose in fact exists.
