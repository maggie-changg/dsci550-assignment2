Location: Memory Hill Cemetery

Description:
If you ever go to this cemetery, you'll know that it's haunted. When you go to the middle of the cemetery, you always feel a cold chill down your back. A girl one time found three squirrels dead & frozen under a tree in the middle of the summer. At night you can hear a girl humming “Amazing Grace”.
