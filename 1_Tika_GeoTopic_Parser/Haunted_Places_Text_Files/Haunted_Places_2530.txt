Location: Dinuba High School

Description:
Football Field - Years ago a young girl broke up with her boyfriend and he began to stalk her. They decided to meet and he strangled her and left her under the bleachers. At that time the bleachers had black plastic around the back because they stored equipment there. The girl's ex-boyfriend left her body there and it wasn't found for a week or so because it was mixed up with all the equipment. It's said that at night you can see her running across the football field.
