Location: Wickham Rail Road Tracks

Description:
A white ball of light, similar to the front of a train engine, has appeared out of nowhere and rides the rails. Many people in the Wickham area have seen this phenomenon. It comes at you so quickly that there is just enough time to jump out of the way. It then disappears quickly as it materialized.
