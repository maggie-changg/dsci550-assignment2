Location: Sherwood

Description:
The house is a three story house, and is filled with friendly spirits. It was also built on ancient burial grounds of the Indians. One of the spirits is a woman, who hung herself in a closet in one of the bedrooms on the second floor. Another spirit is a small boy, who one time got stuck in the garage while it was on fire. The doors always keep opening and closing by themselves.
