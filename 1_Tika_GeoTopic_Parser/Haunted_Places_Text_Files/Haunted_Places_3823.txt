Description:
Sigma Nu House - The Sigma Nu House in Akron has been haunted for many years. The house was purchased by Sigma Nu from a sorority on the campus. Legend has it, one of the sorority members hung herself in the boiler room at the house. Many of the Sigma Nu members have had run-ins with her spirit. Still today, no member of Sigma Nu will go into the boiler room by themselves.
