Location: Cochise Stronghold State Park

Description:
A man playing flute appears on boulders that tower over campsites. It is said that Cochise himself walks in the hills, guarding his pilfered gold from the white man. - May 2005 Update: Cochise was an Apache warrior, so he had no need for gold. It is said that Cochise walked the hills, but it was not for gold. It was to look out for the army that was out to get him.
