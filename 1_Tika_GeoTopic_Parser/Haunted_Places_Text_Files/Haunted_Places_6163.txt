Location: Slater Hall

Description:
Floor One - Legend has it that in the 1800's, a man they called "Penguin man" roamed the vicinity looking for young babies whose brains he liked to feast on. Legend has it that the "Penguin man" has been reincarnated into a fat, black, first floor RA. She roams the halls of Slater looking for innocent young students to eat. SLATER HALL IS VERY DANGEROUS. BEWARE THE WADDLER.
