Location: Robin Hill

Description:
On the top of a hill stands an old white house which has been abandoned for many years. The house was once a stop on the underground railroad. The house is now being remodeled, according to rumor, into a bed and breakfast. It sits on the corner of Mill and 9th. Local lore says that the house is very haunted, but no one really knows by who/what or why.
