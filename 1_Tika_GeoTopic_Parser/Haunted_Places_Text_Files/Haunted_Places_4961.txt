Location: The Mansion-Griffin Gate

Description:
This historical building was once used as a house. A teenager named Gretta lived in it. It is now a restaurant, but employees always warn people about the blue room. It was Gretta's when she lived there. One night she hung herself in her room because a guy had stood her up or turned her down for a date. Visitors claim in the blue room (her room) and every so often the lights and candles would flicker and you'd feel a cold breeze go across your legs, even though there were no vents. A few other people also noticed it too. Then if someone made her mad, Gretta would slam the shutters on the windows and sway the chandeliers a bit
