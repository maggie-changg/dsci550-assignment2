Location: Bannwell bridge

Description:
there is a bridge a few miles south west of clare. there is tree bridges total and if you look on a map it shows up like a triangle and a woman and her kids are supposed to haunt it. if you go there around midnight and stop on the bridge and get out of the car and wait. a womans face is supposed to come down the railroad tracks and it and follow you down the road till you go under a brigde about a quarter mile down the road. further on down the tracks where a road gos across the tracks you can stop your car and some kids will push you across. the story is that she hung her three children over the bridge and a train came along and hit the kids. - May 2004 update: they tore it down and are building a new bridge in its place.
