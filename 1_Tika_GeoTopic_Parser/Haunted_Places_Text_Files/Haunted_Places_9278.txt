Description:
Grant-Lee Dormitory In the mid 1800's,when the university was the Four Seasons Hotel, a fire broke out in the sanitarium, which is now Grant-Lee Dormitory, burning the building to the ground. All survived except for a woman, who was wearing a red dress, and her child, on the forth floor. In the 1960's a fire broke out again, and once again the building was burned to the ground. Witnesses say they saw a lady standing in a forth floor window, wearing a red dress, shouting for help. The sounds of someone up the stairs to the forth floor can sometimes be heard still, and some still claim to see the lady run down the hall to her childâ€™s room.
