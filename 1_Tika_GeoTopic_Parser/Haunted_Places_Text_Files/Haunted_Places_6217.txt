Location: pre school

Description:
orbs seen on the first floor where children sleep. It also seems that there has been a sighting of a young male there as well. All the activities seem to only be done there in the lower level. The ghost maybe that of a young man who was gunned down on the Morningside loop during the mid 1990's. It use to be Lutheran Social Services at one time.
