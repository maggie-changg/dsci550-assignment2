Location: Yankee Silversmith Inn

Description:
This restaurant used to be an inn back in the 1800's. rumor has it that a man committed suicide in one of the rooms. after being changed into an eating establishment\ banquet hall, the staff has seen a ghost walking up and down the stairs after a late night, around 12:30 or 1, when all the guests have left. there is also a feeling of someone behind you as you walk up the stairs. the final piece of evidence is there is a picture of a white ghostly image in the brochure for the hall. no member of management can explain this.
