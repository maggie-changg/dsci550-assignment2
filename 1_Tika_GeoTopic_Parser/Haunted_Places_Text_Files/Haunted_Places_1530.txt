Location: Lowell transitional Living Center (Middlesex Shelter)

Description:
The TV in the women area changes channels and goes on & off by itself. If youâ€™re downstairs alone you will sometimes hear your name called. While in the shower you can see a shadow walk by. Things disappear and will reappear days later in a different spot. While sleeping some have had their beds shaken and blankets pulled down. A few people, while watching TV, have had their shirts tugged at. And once in a while the lights will flicker on & off and radio dials will change on there own.
