Location: The Old Park Floral Building

Description:
After the floral shop shut down they tried to sell it but no one wants to buy it do to its weird happenings. There is a very eerie feeling when you enter the building. Plus it kind of looks like a castle. People have heard a beautiful sound of piano playing from the upper floors, they hear foot steps, noises in the fire place.
