Location: Old School House

Description:
Later became a childrens Hospital - Go around 12 (time of advanced darkness). You walk through the front door and right away you get a weird feeling throughout your body, you look at the wall in front of you and you see burn marks in the wall that spell out "WERE WATCHING YOU", you walk through the main hall and you can here a noise like a chalkboard being written on, thats about the time our two flashlights went out almost simoltaniosly, as you aproach the main staircase you here two women talking of a sick child, one sounds like a worried mother and the other a nurse, you can also here creaking noises from the stairs. While you walking around the school house/hospital you will here different things and noises. The hospital is mainly haunted by the worried mother and her dieing child.
