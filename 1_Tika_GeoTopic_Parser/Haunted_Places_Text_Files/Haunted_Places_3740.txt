Description:
The Hotel - In the 1800's, a hotel was built on the mountain during the war. The Yankees used the motel to hold rebel soldiers. The hotel was only used for a few weeks before the war was over. All the prisoners were killed and half the hotel burned down. If you go down the road at night, you can see an orange glow and hear the screams of soldiers. But if you stop to get a better look, all youâ€™ll find is half of an old hotel.
