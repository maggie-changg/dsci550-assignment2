Location: Hospital woods

Description:
Alexandria INOVA hospital is built on the site of the Vauxcleus mansion, an ante-bellum plantation mansion.  During the Civil War a Confederate soldier was seen and shot dead by a Union picket while sneaking up the ravine to visit a girl friend in the Vauxcleus mansion.  Since, it is said you can see his ghost moving through the woods on moonlit nights.
