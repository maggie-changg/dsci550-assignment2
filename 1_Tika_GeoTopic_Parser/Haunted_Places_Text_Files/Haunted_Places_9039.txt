Location: Driftwood Theatre 6

Description:
In theatre 6 you can hear children playing after close. They run up and down laughing and talking. Also their have been occasions to where people have seen a woman in a white dress walking through that theatre and through the projection booth and offices upstairs. Employees get a creepy feeling going in that theatre because of this. Also things get moved and doors open and close by themselves.
