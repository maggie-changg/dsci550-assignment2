Location: Alexander City

Description:
Oakachoy Covered Bridge - There used to be a covered bridge down the dirt road off Highway 259. If you go there at night and turn your car off, at 12:05AM exactly, your doors will lock themselves and your car will start. It has been said that a slave was lynched there for allegedly messing around with the landowner's wife. He's trying to get people to leave by his actions. He was hung in semi-secret on the bridge at 12:05AM.
