Location: Lilydale Caves &amp; Wabasha Street Caves

Description:
March 2008 Update: Have been removed. It is not encouraged for anyone to go into the Lilydale Caves or the lesser known ACTUAL Wabasha Caves. See attached links to understand. It's bad to encourage anyone else to go here - especially without knowing the dangers could be fatal. This place is extremely dangerous. Please refer to the 2 links listed for proof of any danger at lest 3 teenagers have died from carbon monoxide poisoning  http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/04/28_ap_cavedeaths
