Since during the haunts People working there report Sighting Shadow's of people wearing Victorian era Clothes, Cold Spots, Spots of Extreme Heat, a Hallway that seems to be Unnaturally Dark, and when in there for long amounts of time you hear voices call out your names and hands push you. A deep male voice Telling us to LEAVE US TO REST, and sightings of Strange green, and Red Lights on the roof.
