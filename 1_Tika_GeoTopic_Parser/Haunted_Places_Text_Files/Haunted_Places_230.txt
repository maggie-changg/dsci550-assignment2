Location: Highland Park Cemetery

Description:
Years ago, there was an accident at Oak Hill Cemetery, the other cemetery in Ionia, in which five kids went in at night, though it's not sure what they went in for. One of them had urged the others to leave several times, but they did not listen. By 3 A.M that night, four of them were dead, and the last kid survived in the scatter, but refused to explain what had happened, or how he'd survived, to police or anyone.Â  On the first Saturday of every month between 2 and 3 A.M, if survived walks to the gate, and waits to safely guide you through. It seems as though he can protect you now in death, though he couldn't protect them in life.
