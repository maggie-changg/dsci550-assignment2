Location: Coquina Beach

Description:
On Coquina Beach, at the very southern tip of the island before the Longboat Key bridge, there is a span of public beach where there once was a hotel but now it is a picnic area. On the beach, a male figure in black clothing walks from the picnic area to the shoreline and vanishes. This particular area has a lot of wandering spirits at night, but this male ghost has been seen in daylight and looks totally out of place.
