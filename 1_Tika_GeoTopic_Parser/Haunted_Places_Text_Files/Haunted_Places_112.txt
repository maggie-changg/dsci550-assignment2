Description:
before the Tunnel to Canada - A little girl was hit by a car on a rainy day where the turn for the Tunnel to Canada is. She was stuck under the car and was knocking hoping that the driver would hear her, but he didn't. It is said that when you take that turn on a rainy day you can hear four knocks on the bottom of your car. These knocks belong to the little girl.
