Description:
Gretchenâ€™s Lock - Gretchen was the daughter of a wealthy man, who possibly came from England. Gretchen drowned as a small child in the creek, as many have done over the years. (Swimming is now prohibited in the creek as is canoeing). Gretchen was buried in an actual "lock".... one that was previously used in the canal at the creek in earlier days. Her father moved back to England and was so broken-hearted over the loss of his daughter that he had her body exhumed and moved back to England. The lock remains, but the hauntings do not take place there, but instead, at the place where she drowned, which is now named "Gretchen's Lock" (another smaller part of the Beaver Creek park). It is said by many that Gretchen actually helped others, mostly small children, who found themselves in danger in the creek when swimming was still allowed, and that she can still be seen and heard today. She has been seen by so many that the story is easy to believe. It is also told that you can hear Gretchen crying for all of the other's that had drowned in the creek. She is a very helpful ghost and the most popular here in the Tri-State area.
