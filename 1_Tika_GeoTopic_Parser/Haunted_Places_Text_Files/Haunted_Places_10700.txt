Location: Newberry College

Description:
Keller Hall - The bell tower of this old and no longer used building is said to be haunted by a young woman who, during the Civil War, committed suicide by jumping out of the bell tower when she got the news of her boyfriend's death in battle. There have been reports over the years of screams being heard in the area and also of actual sightings of the woman herself up in the bell tower, watching from above.
