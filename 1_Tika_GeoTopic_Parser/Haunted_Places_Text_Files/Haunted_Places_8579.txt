Location: Bexar

Description:
The train tracks - In the 20's a bus full of kids was struck by a train on the southwest side of town. I have been there, it is real if you put your car there in neutral something pushes your car over the tracks. Sometimes if you look you can see small hand prints people believe this to be the small children who died in that accident.
