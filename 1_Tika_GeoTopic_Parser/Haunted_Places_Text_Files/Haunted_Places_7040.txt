Location: Cedar Canyons

Description:
Near the same spot where the old man may be seen walking on an old country road, there is a cemetery on Cedar Canyons near Auburn Road and the Vandolah Nature Preserve. Go to the cemetery and get out of your car. If you look in the back of the cemetary it has been swore by many that a a pair of eyes and a shadow or two can be seen moving from side to side or even towards you. Several people even claim that if the moon is full and shines right on the middle of the cemetery, you can see a little girl staring back at you.
