Location: High School

Description:
In the old part of the high school on the 3rd floor there is to be know of a ghost named Willy he was a janitor here in the high school and the other janitors say that he still roams here and one janitor said that he was vacuuming in one room and he shut it off and went to another room and when he came back it was running by it self and he was the only janitor in the school so he thought. Sometimes in the restrooms on 3rd floor the stools would run out of know where and a door will shut really loud.
