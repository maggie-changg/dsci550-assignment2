Location: Hollywood on the Flats

Description:
immediately adjacent to the Wetlands, also known as "Hooverville". The last transient was evicted in 1952. The old transient, wearing a batter tan shirt and pants held the Pierce County Sheriff Deputies and Tacoma Police at bay with a shotgun, refusing to leave his "home". The standoff ended with a single gunshot, when the man took his life rather than be evicted. His old yellow mixed breed Lab dog was heard wailing.
