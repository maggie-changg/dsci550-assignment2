Location: Gravity Hill

Description:
It is believed that a man and his two daughters had car trouble at the bottom of this hill. While they were pushing the car down the road, they were hit and killed by a truck. If you stap your car under this overpass, turn it off and put it in neutral, you will sit still for a few minutes and then feel your car being pushed up the hill, all the way to the end of the road. If you put baby powder on the back of your car you will see six handprints on it after you get out.
