Location: O'Neil District

Description:
In the 1840s a werewolf was reported to be killing sheep in Talbot County. So many animals were butchered that a $200 dollar reward was offered to anyone that could kill the werewolf. An odd young girl named Isabella Burton was suspected of being the beast. Whenever she'd leave town, the creature would not be seen nor would any livestock be disturbed, but when she'd return the killings would begin again. One night, a hunter claimed to have wounded the animal, and the next day Isabella had a wound in the same location. After that, the werewolf went away and the killings stop. Isabella is buried in a church cemetery somewhere in Talbot, and people say her spirit still howls at night.
