Location: Oasis Red Bull Tavern

Description:
The bar was built in 1932 where it is said that a man hung himself in the basement. At night you can hear foot steps, objects moving and sudden feelings of discomfort, such as on a 80 degree night, you get a brief ice cold draft across your neck. lights go on and off as do the t.v.'s but no one has ever been injured to to these events
