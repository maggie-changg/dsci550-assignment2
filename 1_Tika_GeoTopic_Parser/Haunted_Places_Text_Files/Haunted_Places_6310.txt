Location: Train Tracks

Description:
If you walk from Weirwood to the Pax City Hall at night a orb starts to follow you. After that when you start running it gets in front of you and is in front of you until you reach the bridge. Then it turns into a man (this man is headless). It is believed to be a man that got his head cut off from the train. He follows you until you get to the bridge. Then he jumps off to the stream below and splashes mud and water on you. Several people have witnessed this.
