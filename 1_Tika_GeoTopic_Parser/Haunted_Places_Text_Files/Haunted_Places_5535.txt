Location: Little Theater

Description:
The Little Theater seems to be haunted by many ghosts. In the shoe room, where they keep all the shoes for performances, the door will slam shut and lock when a person goes in there. The temperature will also drop significantly. Other stories have been told about a male ghost in the boiler room and practice room. People have even reported seeing a man on stage late at night, often playing pranks on people by moving things to where they should not be. He has supposedly spoken to children, luring them across the stage when unattended by their parents.
