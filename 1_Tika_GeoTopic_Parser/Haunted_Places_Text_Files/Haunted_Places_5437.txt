It is said that an 11 year old boy and girl where killed by an old janitor. If someone went into the school at exactly 2:00 a.m. the ghost of Mallina will appear and anyone that stayed in there for more than 2 hours would never be seen again and a lot more kids have done this and were never heard from again.
