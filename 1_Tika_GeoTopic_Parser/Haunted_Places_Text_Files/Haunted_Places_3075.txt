Location: Mount de Sales Academy

Description:
Strange things are always happening. On the fourth floor (unused today) if you stand at one end and look straight through to the other end you could see movement. Also doors open and close and lock without anyone being there. Things are always changing up there, never is anything in the same place twice.
