Location: Elmwood Cemetery

Description:
This is one of the oldest cemeteries in Coffeyville and has many graves over 100 years old, including the graves of the fallen Dalton Gang and the town's Defenders from the gun battle of October 5, 1892 that ensued when the Dalton Gang attempted to rob two banks at once in downtown Coffeyville. The cemetery is a favorite dare of the college students in town to visit after midnight. Strange noises, shadows chasing visitors, and creepy feelings are not scarce.
