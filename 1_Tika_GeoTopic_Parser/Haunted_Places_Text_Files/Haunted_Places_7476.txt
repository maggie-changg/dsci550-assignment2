Location: Lancaster Tavern

Description:
It was established in the 1700's, not sure exactly when, it says on the sign hanging above the door, but there is a very friendly ghost there who every morning makes breakfast. Very early in the morning you can smell bacon cooking when no-one is awake or in the kitchen.
