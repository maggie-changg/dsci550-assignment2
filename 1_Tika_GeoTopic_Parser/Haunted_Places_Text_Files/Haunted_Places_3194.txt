Location: Jeremiah's Bridge

Description:
Cars break down frequently on this bridge, even school buses, but only at night. People claim to have seen a Native American man jumping off the bridge, or have seen blood dripping on their windshield as they drive over the bridge, or dead animals hanging from trees overhanging the bridge that are not there when they stop to cut them down. A team of investigators began taking pictures over the bridge when suddenly, while they were reloading the film, a flash came out from under the bridge as if something was mimicking their camera flash. It came under both sides and it was gone as soon as it happened. Then they drove forward about 15 feet and got out to see a bright ball of white light floating towards us, almost like a flashlight going on and off zigzagging through the trees. It kept coming closer to them and they took pictures of it. They claim that came out quite nicely. - we are waiting for the investigators to send in the pictures.
