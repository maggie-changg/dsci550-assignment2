Location: Vine House

Description:
White and green abandoned house covered with weeds and vines. Its up by Fort Howard. Its been abandoned since 1988 and it looks like there was a fire upstairs.. You have to go in through an alley like driveway and through the garage to the back door to get in. Thereâ€™s a small room in one of the rooms upstairs. There is a huge hole in he wall where it looks like someone was thrown through the wall. Negative energy is felt here, believed to be from a murder of a man and a rape of a girl.
