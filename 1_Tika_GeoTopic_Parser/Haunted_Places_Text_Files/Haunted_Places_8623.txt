Description:
Main Administration Building -  built in 1922, has cold spots and reports of a student's radio dial (non-digital) begin scanning through stations on its own. This same admin building's top (4th) floor was once used as a quarantine for victims of tuberculosis and has seen its share of deaths, which might account for the activity. Additionally, on the 3rd floor of the Admin building, a 5-year-old boy chasing a bouncing ball has been spotted regularly.
