Description:
There have numerous sightings and occurrences in this hotel. One room at the far end of second floor has had reported cases red eyes looking at guests, sounds of someone inside when the room was vacant, staff members have entered and found nothing. One staff member was in the room and started to leave the door handle spun around. As he tried to leave sounds were heard from within the empty bathroom. After several more tries the door opened. A little later he opened the door from the outside on the first try and left the room on the first try. The door has been fine ever since and was never examined by maintenance. A figure described as a cowboy like figure in casual clothes has been observed in the lobby, bar and pool area. Spied just for a moment it vanishes instantly. Room doors on second and third floor have been heard opening and closing behind staff members when the entire floor was vacant. A misty figure has been seen flying down halls. Both staff and guests have observed this sight. Guests have heard voices call out from the back office the clerk at the front desk. What the guest didn't know, the clerk was all-alone. There is more but this is enough.
