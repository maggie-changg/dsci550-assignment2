Location: College Theater

Description:
In the theater while your alone lights will go off and on. You can hear steps on the stage and no one will be there, one seat if you sit in it you will get cold chills and you can feel someone there with you. There is bloody hand prints everywhere and you can hear people talking and sometimes rehearsing a play.
