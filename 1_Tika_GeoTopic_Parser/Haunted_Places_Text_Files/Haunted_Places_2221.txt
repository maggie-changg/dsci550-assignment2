Location: Agaard Road

Description:
Agaard road is on the right side of highway 6 heading to Tillamook from forest grove. between the times of 2 am and 5 am on most mornings a man named Lazlo in flannel fishing wear can be seen where the creek runs under the road. he fishes and smokes his pipe and doesn't harm anyone. just sits there. across the road his wife Helen waits for him with hands on hips and an annoyed expression on her face. during this time smoke is sometimes seen rising from the house in which the couple used to live. lights can also be seen in the windows. the electricity in the hose has been turned off since the late 90's. Also the apparition of a young boy in blue shorts and a striped t-shirt can be spotted on the highway side bank of the creek. he is blue in the face and has water dripping from him (the water never makes spots on the rocks). he has been named Joey. he is usually seen in the late summer in mid- afternoon by the swimming hole. he whimpers and cries for his "mommy and daddy" sometimes Joey is only heard calling for his parents. when someone tries to follow hi he leads you up the side of the bank and disappears before the highway.
