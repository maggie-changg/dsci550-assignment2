Description:
Some say that if you go under all three bridges and under the third bridge you might see the devil. If the Devil has his back to you then you will have a good life but if he is staring you in the face the rest of your life is doomed. Others say that if you see your name under the bridge the next day you are suppose to die. Its a great place to go for a scare.
