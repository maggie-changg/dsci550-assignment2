Location: Holiday Inn

Description:
The hotel sits on land that used to be a plantation known as "Jacob's Lantern".  There is a nightclub called "Attitudes" in the hotel, and the manager has told me of being asked by the front desk to turn the music down, even though there was no music playing.  He also told me of hearing laughter & voices in the club after hours, only to discover no one there.
