Location: East High School

Description:
Little Theater -  The drama director of many years ago (initials RC) was writing a play, but before he could finish it, he fell off the balcony of the theater and died. No one has seen the play that he was writing. Then one day, it showed up on an English teacher's desk with a note on the old East High stationery saying "please perform this" with the initials "RC" on the bottom. The play has never been performed. The lights in the light room mysteriously turn on when the theater is dark. Many students say that it is cold in some parts of the theater, especially near the light board.
