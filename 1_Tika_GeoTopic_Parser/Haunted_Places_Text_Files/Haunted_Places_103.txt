At the time she died Esther Morris was pregnant. And the maid was not killed; she was in the house asleep at the time. The Morrises lived in a house considered by the people of the time to be a mansion, and were considerably wealthy. Additionally the murderer didn't arrive on horseback as far as can be discerned, but he did steal the Morris' buggy pulling horse. The murders took place September 28, 1879. And Anderson cemetery is considered a part of Decatur since it is in Van Buren, not a part of Marcellus, which is in Cass County.
