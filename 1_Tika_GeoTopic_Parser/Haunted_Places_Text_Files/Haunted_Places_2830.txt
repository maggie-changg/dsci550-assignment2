Description:
The Little Rascal's dog Petey, Hop along Cassidy's Horse and Mary Pickford's dog are all interred here. However, the dead animal that does the most haunting here is Kabar, a Great Dane that belonged to Rudolf Valentino. The dog died in 1929 but it's playful phantom is still reported panting or licking people that wander near it's grave.
