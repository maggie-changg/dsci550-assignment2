Location: The Chapel of Ease

Description:
This notorious church is located on St. Helena and now stands deserted. When workers tried to seal up the crypt behind the church, they would find a surprise awaiting them the following morning. The bricks used to seal off the crypt somehow got neatly put in a little pile. All of their work seemed to be in vain for this happened numerous times. Other people have reported strange sensations when walking through the church's graveyard.
