Location: Waverly Manor/Waverly Hills

Description:
Old T.B. and Mental hospital. Includes crematory and body slide. Several cold spots and a young girl has been spotted on several floors but mostly in the basement and on the third floor. Sighting of a young boy with dark hair in old fashioned clothing and hat, by main entrance (golf course) but watch out if you see him he will come up to you wanting to go home with you. Local rumors are that he was a victim of a doctor who preformed illegal experiments on his patients. There is also a body chute that is said to be haunted. The chute was used to transport the dead bodies of TB patients who had died so that the other patients wouldn't see them carting all the dead bodies out of the hospital. Many strange figures and noises can still be heard. Over all feeling of dread in the entire building. - January 2007 Additional information. A visitor has 12 photos out of about 50 that they personally took, and they have orbs in them (one photo has over 20 orbs, and it hadn't rained in days, and there was nothing for light to reflect off of).
