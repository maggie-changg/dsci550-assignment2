Location: Borgess Hospital

Description:
people have seen red lights, and ghosts of the old Sisters (nuns) who used to operate the hospital. There have been reports of children staying in the section known as 1 North feeling as if they are being watched. In the room across the hall from the nurse's station a pair of glowing red eyes has been seen. When you look out at the cemetery next door you get a sick feeling in your stomach.
