Description:
a long time ago, a man was having an affair with his babysitter and soon the wife found out, and the man got mad and took the babysitter and cut her up and put her in a duffel bag and threw her in the river that runs under it. People say that if you go to the bridge midnight on Halloween by the way when it happened) and honk the horn 3x and blink the lights 3x and you get out the car she will rise up and if you try to get in the door will be locked and she is supposed to swoop down.
