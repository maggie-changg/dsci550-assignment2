Description:
There is said to be a ghost of one of the Biology Professors roaming the halls of the science building. He appears to be in his sixties and walks through the labs wearing a white lab coat and carrying a beaker and apothecary bottle. He has also been known to put away glassware and models used in the labs by students when they are done. Animals in the lab have been mysteriously released from their locked cages and microscopes have flown across the room, smashing into walls.
