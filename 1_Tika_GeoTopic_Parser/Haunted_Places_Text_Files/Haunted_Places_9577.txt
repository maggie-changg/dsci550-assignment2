He loved kids so much, he turned half of the mansion into a daycare, but when he found out his wife had an abortion he got mad and his wife -as for revenge- burned the house down with Glenn Curtis inside. There have been reports of lights going on and off also of ghosts playing tennis and some screaming at night. - October 2007 Update: The house was not burned down by Curtissâ€¦ it was an act of vandalism. After Glenn Curtiss's death in the early 1930s, Lena Curtiss married an old friend and business associate of her husband, H. Sayre Wheeler. Wheeler served as mayor of Miami Springs from 1942 to 1944 and was also part owner of the Michaels and Wheeler Insurance Company. The couple lived in the house until the late 1940s. The estate was sold in the mid-50's and became the world renowned Miami Springs Villas. It was sold to Forte Hotels, International, Inc. in the late 1970's and is currently owned by Manor Care, Inc.
