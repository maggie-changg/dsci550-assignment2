Location: The Town

Description:
A carriage will drive through the town. The Episcopal Church is in the tour, and they still hold service there on Sundays. Kingstone Lisle is also in the tour. In the buildings on the tour you can take pictures but cannot use flash when you do. Also, unfortunately, you cannot touch any of the books in the library. All of the buildings are beautiful and there are a couple of cemeteries included in the tour. For more information on the tours go to  www.historicrugby.org
