Location: Old Honeywell bldg on Bluewater

Description:
Supposedly the building was built on or near a Native American grave. A young woman appears to people who work in the dark supply area. A witness saw her in the IT room at the opposite end of the building. She simply walked through the closed door and stood and stared at them.
