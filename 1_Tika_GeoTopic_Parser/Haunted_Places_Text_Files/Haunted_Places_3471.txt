Description:
Badarka Road In The Woods - It is said that deep in the woods, about half way down the road, there is a place where a 5 year old girl was killed. Legend has it that the girl was helping her father chop wood for the fireplace in their small cabin, where her mother and little brother were waiting. The father had put the axe in the tree, so the girl couldn't accidentally fall down on it. The little girl was said to be a very helpful child, and attempted to pull the axe out of the tree and chop the wood herself. While her father was taking a break, the girl pulled the axe out of the tree, and it fell down and hit her in the head. The girl died instantly, with blood running down her face. The father stayed by her side for days and nights in the cold bitter winter of Alaska, and eventually died of hypothermia. It has been said that at 3:30AM you can see the little girl lying dead in h er father's arms, while he mourns over her lifeless, cold, and white little body.
