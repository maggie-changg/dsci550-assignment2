Location: Subway

Description:
Over 60 Years ago a old woman and her little girl used to live here until it burned down. Around 2 at night if you wait by the front of subway you can hear small Cries of the child and screams of the woman. - June 2008 Update: The Subway burned to the ground about a couple of years ago. It was built back up again in the same spot but while the fire was burning they heard screams inside the building but couldn't get in because the structure was collapsing. Later when they inspected the building (basically looking for a body) they found nothing.
