Location: Gwendolynâ€™s house

Description:
short and sweet. not really sure what went on in this early 1900's house right off of Bristol highway. Witnesses say there is heavy activity in a house not surrounded by any living occupants. Ghost dogs, what appeared to be a little girl, and a ghost that told us to leave before she disappeared is just the tip of the iceberg.
