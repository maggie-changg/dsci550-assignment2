Location: The Gates of Hell

Description:
There are two black iron gates standing along the roadside of Sunset street in Redlands. Extremely unusual things are supposed to happen after crossing these gates, such as, a ghost with a headless cat comes running after you, a bloody bull's head rolls down the drive-way, and so on. The black iron gates are still sitting on the road, but the trail leading to the house has been hidden by bushes and trees.  Update: Has been torn down and built over.
