Location: Old Opera House

Description:
She has been named Jessica. She moves things, turns lights on and off. Opens and closes doors. The balcony has cold spots. If you question her presents she will show you by moving something. You don't see it move but you hear it land. If your alone you can hear voices in another part of the building. And don't be surprised if you get a pat on your head for doing a good job.
