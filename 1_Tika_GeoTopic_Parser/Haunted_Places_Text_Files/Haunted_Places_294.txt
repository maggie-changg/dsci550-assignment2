Description:
Music Building - The ghost reported in the Forest Roberts theater elevator can not be because the theater has no elevator! The music building does, however, and it is where a janitor named Perry had a heart attack in the 60's. The elevator moves up and down on its own at all hours. It has even been recorded at midnight and later when nobody else has been near the building but music students practicing.
