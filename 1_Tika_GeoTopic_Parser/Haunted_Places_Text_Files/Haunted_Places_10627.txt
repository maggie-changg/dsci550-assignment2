Location: Fort Jackson -The B Company 369th AG Barracks

Description:
You can late at night see a black shadowy mist of a man (mostly on the 2nd floor) walking to each room like he was checking on his soldiers then go in the bathroom and close the door.  Eerie feeling in the day room with the big screen TV.  Feel like you are being watched n the room.
