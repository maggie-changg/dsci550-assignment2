Location: Bishop Noll Institute

Description:
Aditorium - They have said of a story about the auditorium of Bishop Noll Institute. About a young girl who was auditioning for the lead part in a play, but because she did not receive the part she started crying. She walked on the lights above the stage and hung herself. Ever since then, anyone who auditions and gets the lead part or a part with many lines has gotten hurt. They lose their voice, develop illnesses, break their leg, almost choke, fall off the stage, and much more during the play.
