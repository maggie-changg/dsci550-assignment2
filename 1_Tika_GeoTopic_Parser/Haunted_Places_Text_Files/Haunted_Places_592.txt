Description:
A student, Lillian, haunts Merion Hall. She went here in the beginning of this century. She believed she had leprosy, although the doctors could find nothing wrong with her. To cure herself, she took a bath in kerosene, and knocked a lantern in to the bathtub. She is said to have run screaming in flames down the hall.
