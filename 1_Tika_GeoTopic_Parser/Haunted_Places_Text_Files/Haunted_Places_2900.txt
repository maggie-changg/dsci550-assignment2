Location: Deer Valley High School

Description:
This is the site of a random Romeo haunting that has lasted over 20 years. Auditorium patrons and players have experienced many occurrences of the supernatural. Some examples are kids crying in the back hall, a longing wail of affection for a lost lover, and the shorting out of lighting and sound equipment.
