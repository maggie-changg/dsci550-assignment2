Location: Sunrise Park

Description:
There was a man in his mid 40s where he had a house by the trees and was right next to a school. People have weird tingling in there back and when they turn around it gets very hard to breathe. PLUS THERE HAS BEEN SCREMING IN THE WOODS OF THE PARK. Later then his house had to be destroyed because of complaints from the parents. So then he got revenge on the children by killing them every day from the mid 1800s to now. then he would leave the bones in this little area surrounded by wood.. That is why Bartlett is so lightly populated today.
