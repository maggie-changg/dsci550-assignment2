Location: Lincoln Heights

Description:
Lincoln High School - Underneath the school there are tunnels where they used in case of bombs in the early 1900's. In the 1960's a mother of one of the black panthers hid her black panther son there for 3 years. In those tunnels there is an abandoned shooting range and you hear those guns going off during school hours. And early in the morning around 6:30 when the hall lights are off you see student apparitions in the distance of the oldest building there.
