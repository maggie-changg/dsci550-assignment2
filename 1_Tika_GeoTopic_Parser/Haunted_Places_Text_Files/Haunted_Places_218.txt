Location: Shoe Tree

Description:
Possibly debunked as there is a peacock farm across the road, which would explain the answering screams. - On the side of the road there's a gnarled tree around 70 feet tall. A kid walked by the tree everyday on his way home from school, and a couple bullies would stop him take his shoes and hang them on the tree so he could get them. He was found dead one day behind the tree in a swamp. Now the tree his covered with shoes, and at midnight if you get out of your car and scream, he'll scream back for help. - October 2007 Update - The tree has been cut down.
