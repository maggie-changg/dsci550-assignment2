Location: Palace Theatre

Description:
The Palace Theatre is an old 1920's era theatre that is undergoing some restoration. Many people have heard voices, footsteps, felt "fingers" run down their arms or neck. There have been a few investigations all of which have offered great pictures of both orbs and ectoplasm as well as many EVP recordings. The board of directors is pretty open to letting groups have investigations so if anyone wants an active night contact the Palace Theatre Company also listed as he Wayne Historic Theatre.
