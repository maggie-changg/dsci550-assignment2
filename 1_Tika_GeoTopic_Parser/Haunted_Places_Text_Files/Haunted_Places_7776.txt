Location: Cemetery

Description:
On the road that leads back to Brattleboro there is an old cemetery that spans both sides of the road. The story is a husband & wife died a few years apart & were buried on separate sides of the road. On their anniversary in either September or October you can see the ghosts come out of the cemetery & meet in the middle of the road.
