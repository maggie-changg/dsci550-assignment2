Location: Stone Quarry

Description:
At night in three ghostly lights can be seen two of them red, and one white. In the late 1700's a Mingo Indian chief had a white wife, and another Indian whom he loved. The Indian pushed the chief and his white wife over the cliff, but fell in with them. They were refused a Christian burial, and now, you can see the three lights struggle on the top and fall, disappearing near the Tuscarawas River.
