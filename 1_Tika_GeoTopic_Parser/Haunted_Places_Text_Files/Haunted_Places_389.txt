Location: Holland Ave.

Description:
Early one morning when the teachers had just started to arrive they heard a student scream, and ran into the hallway to check, the screaming was gone and a locker 179 swung open. Inside layed half of a girls body, the rest was never recovered, and they never figured out who she was.
