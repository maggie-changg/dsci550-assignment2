Back in the 70's the boy was playing basketball for his PE class, as he went up for a shot someone took his legs out from under him and he crushed his skull and broke his neck. Late at night after hours you can hear the young man playing and you can encounter a ghostly figure walk up to you and ask " Do u got game "? then laugh and disappear.
