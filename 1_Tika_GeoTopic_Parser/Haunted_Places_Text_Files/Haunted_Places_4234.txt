Location: Crybaby Bridge

Description:
To the east of Troy, where LeFevre Road crosses Lost Creek, before you get to North Childrenâ€™s Home Road, is Crybaby Bridge. Late at night, a baby can be heard crying beneath the bridge. Legend has it that in the 1930's a couple were crossing the bridge and had an automobile accident. Their baby was ejected from the car and never found. It cries for it's parents.
