Location: Palmer Mansion

Description:
During the Civil War Era, a black man and his wife burned to death on the location of the huge Southern Mansion owned by the Palmer Family. The current residents have seen a figure of the black man standing in the doorways. They also hear him making noises all through the night. The mansion also has a small round window to a room that has no access from the inside of the house! Guests have seen objects move by themselves in the house.
