Location: The Waters House

Description:
In the late 1800's, the Waters family had recently bought and built a farm house, and they used to be the richest in there family, so they had family members living there with them. One night one of there jealous relative came down to the master bedroom and killed both of the owners. These days, neighbors have reported that you can see lights in the attic, and inside doors open and shut on their own, even though no one lives there now since it is under government protection - June 2005 Update â€“ The house was purchased a few years ago by the Montgomery County Historical Society and is now open as a museum. It is on the historic register and is now protected (as it sits relatively in the middle of a subdivision). It has been rehabilitated and can be rented for special events. www.montgomeryhistory.org
