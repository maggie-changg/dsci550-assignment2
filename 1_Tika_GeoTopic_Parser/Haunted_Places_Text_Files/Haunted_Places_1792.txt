Location: Regis College

Description:
College Hall - 4th Floor - people have heard the clanking sounds of beads, from the former sisters who still haunt there. Some witnessed seeing a lady late at night wearing the full habit, nodding and then disappearing. The elevator is supposedly where a girl committed suicide, late at night people complain of a creepy, cold feeling and of a feeling of intense pain and fear. One girl walked off the elevator crying, "Sorry, Sorry!"
