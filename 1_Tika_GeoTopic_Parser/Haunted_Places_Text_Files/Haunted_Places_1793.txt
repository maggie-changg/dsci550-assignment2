Location: Regis College

Description:
College Hall - 2nd Floor - In The Grand Foyer there have been sightings of a man, thought to be an old piano teacher. When walking by Joseph Hall people have seen a man out of the corner of their eye. Also, the doors to the porch open and close on their own. The doors were opening and closing, with no wind blowing. If you ask politely for the opening and closing to stop the door will slowly close on it's own completely and not open again.
