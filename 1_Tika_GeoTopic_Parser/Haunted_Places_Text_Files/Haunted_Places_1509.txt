Location: Main St.

Description:
4 years ago a kid by the name of Emilio died in a driveby on the corner of Sargeant and Main. Because he was innocent and just at the wrong place at the wrong time his presence is felt on the streets at night. Walking alone you feel his touch if your a girl but if your a guy you feel like you're being strangled for a few seconds and then it goes away.
