Location: Greenwood cemetery

Description:
There are lights in the back corner of the cemetery at nighttime. When you walk forwards you can see something hanging in a tree and if you blink it will disappear. Up in frobt of the mausoleum you can see and hear little children playing, and when you walk towards them and smile they will smile back at you, and wave and disappear.
