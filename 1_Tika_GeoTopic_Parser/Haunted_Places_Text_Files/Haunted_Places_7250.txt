Location: St. Joseph's College

Description:
Dwenger Hall - It is supposedly possessed. Students of the dorm next to this shut down building have claimed to see lights coming from inside. Many also claim a force compelling them to look into the windows. Rumor is that the priest who preformed the exorcism, committed suicide after it failed. (If it was in Dwenger Hall or The Theater is unclear.)
