Location: RD 108/Demaree RD

Description:
Between Tulare and Visalia on Demeree between Oakdale AVE and AVE 272 there has been sites of a black figure either running across the road or walking on the side of the road. Don't see to many people walking out, it is a very eerie but well traveled country road. Also when there is no fog anywhere there will be patches of fog or mist that will always be at eye level no matter how tall you car is. Stories have been told about a tree out there across the street from the dairy out there where people use to be hung. Further research is being conducted to give better information.
