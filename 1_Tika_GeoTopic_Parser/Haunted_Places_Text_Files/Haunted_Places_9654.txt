Description:
In this building sightings are expected because they happen like clockwork. Many people have said to see an elderly man walking the halls with an old lantern, he speaks in another language. He is said to appear in a mist and vanish in a bright flash of blue light. When the people see him, they are not afraid because he is not an evil spirit, but instead he is kind and helpful. Some workers in the building said that if they knock something off the wall or shelf he will catch it hand place it back where it was, they say that he even helps them clean messes and junk.
