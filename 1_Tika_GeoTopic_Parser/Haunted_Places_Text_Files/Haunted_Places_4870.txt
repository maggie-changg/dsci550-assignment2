Description:
Kenan Girls Dormitory -  late at night you can hear Mrs. Kennan walking down the halls. The forth floor is shut off and locked in Kennan because of strange happens. It is said there's a green glow all along the forth floor windows visible at night. Some say this is the energy of passed on students. Just remember to never say a bad thing about Mrs. Kennan.
