Location: Wal-Mart

Description:
ghost keep unstocking the shelves as you are stocking and know one is in that part of the store. The new super center opened up a short distance from the old store and it still is happening. If you tell "Oscar" to leave you along and stop tearing the place up he will stop and sometimes, he just may go bother some other stocker.
