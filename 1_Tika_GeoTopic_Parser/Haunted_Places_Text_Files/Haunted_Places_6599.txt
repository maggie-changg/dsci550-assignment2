Location: Pioneer Cemetery

Description:
A black figure has been seen towards the back of the cemetery, towards a tree that overlooks a memorial like headstone, breaking a tree branch, about six inches thick broke, and chasing the visitors. All of the families around there have had strange happenings. Someone has said to have had seen lanterns in the graveyard held by unknown persons. Others have experienced the lanterns in their own yards, displaying a kind of light show. Once you walk out to investigate it, they stay for a moment, start coming towards you and than disappear.
