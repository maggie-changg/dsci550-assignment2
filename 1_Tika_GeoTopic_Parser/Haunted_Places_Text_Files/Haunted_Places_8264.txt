Location: Downtown railroad tracks

Description:
The area is haunted by the spirit of Cherokee chief Red Bird. It's said the chief was thrown from his horse during a race and died of his injuries. According to legend he's buried underneath where the railroad tracks now run. Train crews have reported strange lights around the bend of Crown Cotton Mills, and there have been many strange car accidents along the tracks, caused by the angry Chief.
