Location: Olivet College

Description:
Margaret Upton Conservatory of Music -  The college was founded in 1844. In the Conservatory, there have been reports of piano music being played when there is no one in the practice rooms. Folks say that it is Margaret Upton whom the Conservatory is named after. Also there is something in Dole Hall one of the campus dormitories. In the basement when walking away from the laundry room you will feel like something is staring at your back. No reason why this is but there have been different reports of it. Rumor has it that during a period when the cemetery was being moved to make room for the growing college a few bodies weren't found and put into the new cemetery. The old cemetery is where Dole Hall now stands.
