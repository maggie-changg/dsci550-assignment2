Location: Spring Lake Park

Description:
The town that dreaded Sundown. A couple was there making out and were murdered. Rumor is that the girl was tied to a tree and stabbed to death, if you stand by that tree, you feel rope being tied around you. -  October 2005 Update/ Additional Info: The story is that they both were victims of the notorious Phantom Killer of Texarkana in 1946. They have gotten out of the High School prom and went to a make out spot although they were told not to go there since the Phantom hadn't been caught. The girl was indeed tied to a tree and stabbed, but in a rather unique way: the Phantom tied his knife to the slider of her trombone and pretended to play it while simultaneously stabbing her. Today the Phantom Killer is STILL at large
