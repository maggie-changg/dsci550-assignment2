Location: Phillips Middle School

Description:
The school is supposedly haunted by a young boy who drowned in the pool. The boy has been sited peeking around corners and playing jokes on people. Also at night you can see a red glow and the smell of fire because of the alleged grease fire that happened in the home-ec room several years ago.
