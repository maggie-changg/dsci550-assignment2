Location: Camp Kiwanee

Description:
This place is VERY haunted. In 1905 a woman by the name of Alice Burrage got hung. No one knows who did it, but at that same time the caretaker disappeared. Also, in 1922 a boy got his leg caught in something. When they found out what it was, they found out that it was a man's ribcage, that dated back to 1905!Alice got hung upstairs. If you go up there, the rocking chair moves on its own. You also hear screaming.
