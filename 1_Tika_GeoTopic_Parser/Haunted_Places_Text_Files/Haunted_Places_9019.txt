Location: Scott Theatre

Description:
A young actor, Ken Yandell apparently hanged himself from a pipe in the basement of this theater. His ghost seems to spend most of time in the strange corridor filled basement where he died. A wardrobe woman was so frightened one night by cackling coming from the stage, that she left and never returned.
