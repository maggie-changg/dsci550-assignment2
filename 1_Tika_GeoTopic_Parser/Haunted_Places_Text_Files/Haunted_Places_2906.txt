Location: Salt River

Description:
At the division, fishers can sometimes see a shadow on the wall that looks like the Mona Lisa. It is a rocky area, and there are lots of possibilities for suicides or murders. There was a sighting of something walking. There were no trees or people around at the time. It stopped in front of the wall when a light was shined in that area. The rivers of Arizona have long been a good sight for seeing ghosts, especially in the morning.
