Description:
NASA/GSFC - Bldg #26 -  Many guards on nights and weekends have had a many strange experience at this bldg! Indian chiefs being seen in windows from the outside of the bldg. Bell being heard. Feelings as if someone was hung in a room under the loading dock of the bldg. a guard at NASA got a call one night on the radio to call the comm center, so they went in an office to do so! they heard some one typing on a computer keyboard....being there are people that work all hours of the night they figured nothing of it....when they was done they rounded the corner to find no one sitting there and only a key board no computer!
