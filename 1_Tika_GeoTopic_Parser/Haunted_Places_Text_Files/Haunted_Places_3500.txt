Location: Spanish Moon

Description:
This downtown area nightclub is inhabited by at least one known ghost. During the 1880's, the building served as a firehouse. It has seen many occupants since then. It was even used as a "wino flophouse" about thirty years ago. This era is where the spirit is believed to have originated from. Manifestations include apparitions of a young man; beer taps turning themselves on, strange noises, and flying glassware.
