Location: CVC (Clinton Valley Center)

Description:
Your description of this asylum is accurate, it was a very creepy place even while it was still in working order as a mental institute, noises, people walking behind you in the hallway when no one was there. However, as you stated, it has been demolished. Of the patients that were within the place upon closure, many were turned free to walk the streets and fill some of Pontiacs shelters. The tunnels where people were really held and tortured a hundred years ago with shock therapy are said to be still in tact but there are now new subdivisions atop of where the institution once was. The feeling of that area is still very eerie.
