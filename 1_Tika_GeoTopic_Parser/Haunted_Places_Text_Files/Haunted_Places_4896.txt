Location: Cemetery On a hill over looking the Hi Hat post office

Description:
Its a spot thru the years that a lot have people have visited over the years, so it is untelling what has happened there. Anyway if you visit this cemetery late at night like 1 or 2 something will sound like it is running beside the old church banging very hard on the walls. Sometimes this unseen force that will rock your whole vehicle will slam your whole vehicle. It has a weird feeling like your being watched, and you can see things that cant be there. Itâ€™s really a creepy place.
