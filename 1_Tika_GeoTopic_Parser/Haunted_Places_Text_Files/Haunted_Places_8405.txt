Location: Bay Springs Church/Cemetery

Description:
Many happenings are reported for this church and cemetery. One of the stories is that a man who was known to be quit mean, and a known atheist, went out into a field and said if there is a god let him strike me dead. Lighting struck him dead on the spot, lightening then struck his casket at the funeral, and sticks his head stone now on a regular basis. Many voices and strange noises are heard coming from the church at night. It is told that it sounds like every pew in the church is flipped over at once.
