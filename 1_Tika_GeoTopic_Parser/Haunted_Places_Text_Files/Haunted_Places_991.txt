Description:
a ghost of a caring nun haunts the 6th floor of the old building.(use to be Devine Mercy Hospital) the 6th floor was the OB department until the late 60s when it closed. Her name is believed to be Sister Mary Loretta. She is always looking out for staff and others. And she has been said to have been many times my patients at night who tell other staff members that a nun was in there room and brought them a blanket or a water pitcher. There are no nuns at mercy providence who care for patients anymore.
