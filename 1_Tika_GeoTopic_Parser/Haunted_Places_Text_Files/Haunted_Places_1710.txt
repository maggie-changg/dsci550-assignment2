Location: St. Stephen's Cemetery

Description:
A great deal of strange occurrences happen at St. Stevens. There is a gravestone with the last name Dousette by the big iron cross that used to glow green. Scientists came into the graveyard to figure out why it glowed green, and could come up with any answer. They eventually turned the stone a little out of place and the stone turned red for several days, then stopped glowing. If you take the name apart, Dousette, you can make "do you see it." If you drive into St. Stephens graveyard, the first thing that you will see is a big iron cross (that looks creepy). Take a left and drive back towards the woods on a dark night. When you go over the small hill and are facing the woods, flash your lights twice. A strange man will sometimes come out and tell you how to find spirits. There is a strong presence there, and many things have been seen there, such as a glowing orb that followed a visitorâ€™s car out.
