Location: Cemetery

Description:
It is said to be haunted, It is said there are weird lights, people running, noises. My boyfriend said he was in the cemetery one night and they were in a car. All of a sudden he said it felt and sounded like someone had either jumped on the back of the car or pushed down on it. Then again on top of the car. When they got out to to see what it was no one was around but a lit candle on a grave stone.
