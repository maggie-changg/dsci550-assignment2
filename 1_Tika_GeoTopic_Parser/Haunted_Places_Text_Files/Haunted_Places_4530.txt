Location: St. Ann's Nursing Home

Description:
This building used to be a convent for nuns. It was left vacant for years and people have seen a figure of a woman in the bell tower windows. It has recently become a nursing home and the bell tower is sealed off from residents. The figure is presumably Sister Mary Murphy, who through herself from the tower in 1978.
