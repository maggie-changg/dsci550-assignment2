Location: Quincy Leaf Theatre

Description:
Numerous spirits haunt this building in downtown Quincy. There are several in the balcony and upstairs area, some in the backstage area, and some on the main floor in the seating area. None seem to be malevolent as there are many theatre productions that go off without a hitch.
