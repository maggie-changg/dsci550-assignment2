Location: Woodside Cemetery

Description:
The story goes that back in the mid 1800s 5 men were hung for a robbery of a bank in another state. If you go there late at night you will see the glimmers of 5 men hanging from a tree that no longer stands. The tree was removed when the cemetery was being put in because people claimed they seen these ghosts and thought removing the tree might stop.
