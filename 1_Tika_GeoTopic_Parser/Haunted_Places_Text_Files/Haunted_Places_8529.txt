Description:
It is said that a janitor who was fixing the light in the catwalk fell to his death in auditorium. He fell in about the 6th row and if you sit there during a production or in the sound room you will get chills. If you walk up the stairs to the sound room there is a door to the roof and sometimes you can hear it slam. Also there is a girl their who hung herself because she did not get the lead role in a play and she is said to play tricks on the students putting on a production.
