Location: Old Davis Hospital

Description:
The old Davis hospital which is empty is haunted by numerous "ghosts". People who are brave enough and sneaky enough to go in will feel the presence of former patients following them through the halls, a baby crying is heard near the pediatrics ward, there is an overbearing feeling of dread through out the entire building, and it remains cold and drafty even during summer months when temperatures reach 100 degrees or more. Davis is private property, so don't venture there without permission.
