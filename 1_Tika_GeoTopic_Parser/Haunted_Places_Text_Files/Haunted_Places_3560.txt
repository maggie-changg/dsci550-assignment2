Location: The Bourbon Orleans Hotel 717 Orleans Ave (Located in the Vieux Carre')

Description:
Confederate Soldiers have been seen walking down halls cold spots in the ballroom. There is guestroom that people hear a little girl crying, when employees go in there is nobody there. Then of course there is basic stuff, Hotel guests that feel a presence at the end of their beds, upon turning on lights the sheets are rumpled as if someone were just sitting there.
