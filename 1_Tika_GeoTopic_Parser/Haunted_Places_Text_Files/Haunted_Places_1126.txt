Location: The Indian Rock Inn

Description:
There are many things that happen here. Now a Bed and Breakfast w/Bar & Restaurant (great food!) - you should try staying the night and see if you witness anything! Before it became the bed & breakfast it is now, it was a place for actors from a former nearby haunted hay ride -property for that has since sold and is being semi-developed. The true original history of the building is not really known. Given it's age & remote location, you can only imagine what could have gone on in a bar/inn like that in it's heyday. Faucets turn themselves off and on. Shadows and apparitions have been seen. Strange knockings have been heard. And doorknobs shake for no apparent reason.
