Description:
Shawnee State University - Massie Hall - the main building on campus. Cold spots, shadows, and strange noises, usually at night, and mainly in the basement, 2nd, and 3rd floors. On, the second floor, reports of seeing shadows on the wall, as if a student set down at a desk, complete with sounds of the books hitting the desk. On the third floor, you will hear footsteps and occasional whispers when no one else is on the floor.
