Location: William Penn Hotel

Description:
The unused 22nd and 23rd floor are haunted. Was a female dormitory for a while early in the century. There was a murder in there. Night watchman report, gusts of cold wind, (windows not open), feeling the presents of people watching and unusual sounds of laughter and feet shuffling.
