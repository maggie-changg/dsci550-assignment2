Description:
West Boggs Park - Some nights after 10 p.m. you can see a ghostly figure of a woman running through the woods. They say it is the mother of a child who drowned in the lake. You can hear her screams as she looks for her son, and some say that if you go to the lake at midnight you can see the boy swimming in the lake.
