Location: Highway 101

Description:
On Highway 101 there is this group of trees on your way to San Juan Bautista. It is said that when you are driving at night, if you flash your lights and you will see the local 'witch' and all of her horrors. You will see bodies hanging from the trees, children standing on the side of the road with their eyes bleeding. You will see animal corpses alongside the road and last but not least you will see the witch herself standing in the middle of the road. There have been many accidents on this road because of people swerving to not hit her.
