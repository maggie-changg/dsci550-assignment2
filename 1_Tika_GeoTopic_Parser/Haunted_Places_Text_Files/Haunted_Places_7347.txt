Location: Wauconda Cemetery

Description:
Highway 59 - Cemetery is haunted by the spirit of a man who lost a limb trying to catch a train when he fell under the wheels. Many years ago Wauconda did have a train that ran from Wauconda to Lake Zurich in Lake County. Oddly enough, the train tracks were located behind the Wauconda Cemetery. The Train started in Wauconda in 1913, and it didnâ€™t lasted more than five years.
