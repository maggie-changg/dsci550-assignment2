Location: Coulterville Road

Description:
At the bottom of Coulterville Road, when you must make a 90-degree right turn, is where strange activity has occurred. If you turn up Eighth Street and made a left at the top of that street and continue down to the end, there is an old church and a small cemetery. You can hear footsteps and children and see figures out of your rear-view mirror.
