Description:
The Theatre next to the school is haunted, when you are by yourself walking down the hallway outside the dressing rooms you can hear footsteps following you, when you turn around you can actually hear them run off and disapear! Also backstage their are random spots that are ice cold and 2 feet away it can be very warm.
