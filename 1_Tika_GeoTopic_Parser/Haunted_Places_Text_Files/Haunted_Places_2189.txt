Location: Sardis Pipeline

Description:
A glowing light that flickers very rapidly, bounces up and down a tree line. It always originates from the same cedar tree tops. If you watch it for a long period of time, it seems to get very agitated, shooting up above the trees. The reason is unknown for it being there. Some people have experienced a bumping on the back of their cars upon leaving the sight.
