Location: Fire Station 2

Description:
Reports of many of the fire personnel that work there state that at night, a lone figure shuffles across the apparatus floor knocking over fire boots and rattling the coat hangers. Some think it is the ghost of a firefighter that refuses to retire even after death. The description is of a tall figure, glasses and mumbles about the old days gone by. The watchman of the night shift always keeps one light on for fear of this poor shade.
