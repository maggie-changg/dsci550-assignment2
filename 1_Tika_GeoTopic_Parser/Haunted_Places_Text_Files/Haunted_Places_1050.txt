Location: The Industrial Smokestacks

Description:
The place is closed and deserted now, but when the factory was opened, one worker killed another worker who was in a wheelchair in the basement of this place. When you are in there at night you can hear things moving around and for some reason there is a wheelchair at the bottom of the stairway to the basement, and it seems to be in a different place every time you look away and turn back.
