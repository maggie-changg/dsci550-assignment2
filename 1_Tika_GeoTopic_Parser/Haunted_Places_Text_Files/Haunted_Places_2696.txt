Description:
Errol Flynn's Former Estate - Residents in the neighboring homes have reported lights of all shapes and colors on the property. And noises of that of a social gathering or gala party going on. The most active month is usually August, when these noises are heard on almost a nightly basis. Very amusing considering that all that is left of the home is the foundation and a tennis court.
