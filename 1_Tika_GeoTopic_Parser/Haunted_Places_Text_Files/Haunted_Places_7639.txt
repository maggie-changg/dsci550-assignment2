Location: B.J.'S Bayou Restaurant

Description:
Numerous spirits evidently inhabit this old building that once was a hotel. The building was flooded and abandoned after the Teton Flood of 1976. It was purchased and renovated in the 1980's and now houses a Cajun restaurant, bar, and residence of the owners. The owners report seeing and hearing evidence of haunting all of the time. They report the appearance of the spirit of a young girl, and the spirit of an old gentleman, possibly in a uniform.
