Description:
Hells Hallow – Maude’s Grave -September 2005 Update/correction: Formerly listed as 3 separate listings, Maude's Grave can be approached far more easily from the Sterling end of Hell Hallow Road, and is actually on that side, not Voluntown. The grave is a pile of rocks about ten feet from the road (on the right side if you are coming from Sterling) that can be found from a cleared path. It can easily be visited without being bothered. Sightings of a 17 foot tall black flash have been seen, about 2 feet above ground, crossing the road in front of car headlights, and then chasing the car, in addition to everything already said. - An Indian girl was killed by English soldiers in the section of the forest. Ever since, cries attributed to her have been heard there. The ghost of a little girl named Maude has been appearing for 100 years on Hell Hollow Road near her gravesite. It is located along Hells Hallow Road. When riding in a car and her name is uttered by her gravesite, the car is supposed to either stall or crash. Observers have also seen orbs. Also, a man running through the woods at the same speed of the car was seen by a passenger in a vehicle. When walking on trails a heavy ominous presence can be felt and on the driving trail there are several patches of forest that are completely dead and in one location is a perfectly round pool of water that is lifeless just pure stagnation, it is said that this area was a host to witchcraft and satanic rituals being held.
