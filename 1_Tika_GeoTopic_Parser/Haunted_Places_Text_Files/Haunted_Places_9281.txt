Location: Ellis Middle School

Description:
Formerly Hendersonville High School, this school is reputed to be haunted by a phantom known as "The Colonel." A former night cleaning staff working at night have heard his footsteps walking the upstairs hall when the place was supposed to be empty and another person has seen a figure lurking in the windows of the library on the second floor. The round structure was built with a lot of steel which might account for the nature of the sounds and haunting.
