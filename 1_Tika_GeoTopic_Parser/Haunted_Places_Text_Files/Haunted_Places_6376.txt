Location: Norman Petty Studios

Description:
Ghosts have not been seen first hand here, but have been photographed. Phantoms include: a group young men who were photographed in the living quarters of the old studios (now a museum) and strange orange lights in the same location. Sensitive visitors have wanted to cry for no reason.
