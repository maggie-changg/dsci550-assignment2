Location: William Tyndale college

Description:
There have been many occurrences with employees especially the buildings and grounds workers of the sound of a woman walking down the hallway in hi-heel shoes. This could seem to be normal but all the doors in the building are locked and the workers are 100% sure there is no one there. There have also been the sounds of children playing but there is no one there.
