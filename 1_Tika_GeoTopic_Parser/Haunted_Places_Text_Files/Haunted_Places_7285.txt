Various interpretations have been given for the mysterious moans and noises coming from the hotel's sixth floor. Once serving as the employee dorm, it is now a large storage area. Some say that the floor is haunted by a chambermaid who drowned herself in the nearby Fox River, sometime in the 1970`s. She is rumored to have been left at the altar. Investigators found evidence, but no trace of the woman was uncovered.
