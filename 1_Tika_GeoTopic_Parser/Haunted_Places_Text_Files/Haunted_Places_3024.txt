Location: Bates High School

Description:
This is not to tell you about a haunting. This is to tell you that what you have listed for this location is not correct. I went to Bates in the late 1960's and it was then Bates Middle School and it was not just blacks there. I lived in Annapolis from the time I was born until 1991 when I was 38 years old and have never heard of anyone thrown from the widows of this school. I am not saying that there is not something at this school. I do have the gift, but what is reported on your site is not quite right.
