Location: Death Valley

Description:
This is a strait stretch of I-65 that runs between Cave City and Glasgow. It isn't lined with trees or anything. Several fatal car accidents have happened here. It is said that this piece of I-65 was build over an Indian burial ground, and it is thought that this is what is causing the wrecks.
