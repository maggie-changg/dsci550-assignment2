Location: St. Jon's Landing Apartments

Description:
Various apartments are haunted in this complex. Originally built as military housing back in the thirties and has a cemetery on site in the middle of the complexes grounds. When the military base closed in Green Cove Springs, the housing was sold to a private owner and over the years became slum until 1997. Then a new owner took over the apartment complex and began restoring the buildings back to their original glory. There have been many sightings of apparitions, shadows and electrical charges in the air. Tenants report voices, doors opening and closing, and footsteps up stairs and through out the apartments.
