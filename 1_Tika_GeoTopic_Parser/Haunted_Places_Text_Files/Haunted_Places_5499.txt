Location: Hobart and William Smith Colleges

Description:
Hirshson - Rm 304 -  will fly off of shelves by themselves, the pull blind will pull down by itself, and then roll up to the top. There are also scratching sounds along both walls around one in the morning and about once a week, it sounds as if someone is walking around the room and tapping on the desks when no one else is there. Images have also been seen in the door mirror.
