Location: Spotsville Baby

Description:
There is a lake down in Spotsville Kentucky. Back in the 1800's It is said that a 13 year old girl had gotten pregnant. And did not want her parents to find out. So she took her baby to the lake, and drowned the baby by throwing it in the lake. Now to this day. When you drive to the lake and park on the dock, turn your car off and headlights. Have nothing on. The baby will crawl out of the lake. Crawl on to your hood and peek inside of the windshield. If you try to turn your car on at all. It wont start. Nothing will, until the baby crawls back into the lake.
