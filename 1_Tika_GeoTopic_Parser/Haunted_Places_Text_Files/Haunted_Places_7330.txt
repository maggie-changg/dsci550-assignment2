Location: Historical Museum

Description:
Witnesses claim to have Caught many things on film here. Everything from orbs to a small mist. The arbs seem to center around the old front staircase. The building was used as a halfway house for several years by the 3rd owners of the property. It is now used as a historical museum. Supposedly the old crib in one of the upstairs exhibits moves occasionally even though the area is closed off.
