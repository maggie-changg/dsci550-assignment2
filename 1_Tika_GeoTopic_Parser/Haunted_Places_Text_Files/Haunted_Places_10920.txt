Location: The Hell Tree

Description:
Back in the early 1900's a farmer would hang his farm hands from this tree. One afternoon they rebelled against him. Later that evening his wife found him hanging from this tree. Sometimes on a late night when the moon is silhouetting the tree you can see the farmer and his farmhands hanging in this tree.
