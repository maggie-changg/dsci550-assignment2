Location: Jericho Covered Bridge

Description:
This bridge is the last covered bridge standing in Harford County, built in the early 1800's. Legend has it that several lynching occurred at this bridge during and after the Civil War, in which the captured people were hung from the upper rafters, sometimes many at a time. If you stop your car on the narrow bridge late at night, and look in your rear view mirrors, the image of a swinging body can be seen.
