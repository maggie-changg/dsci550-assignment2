Location: Gaithersburg High School

Description:
School was built in early nineteen hundreds. One night the boiler room started acting up and a janitor went to investigate. There was an explosion and of course the janitor died. Certain times of the day(mainly at night) you can hear the jingling of his keys in the halls.
