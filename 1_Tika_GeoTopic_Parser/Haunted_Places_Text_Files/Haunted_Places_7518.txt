Location: the old naval hospital

Description:
Bldg 1 - built in 1827. Some people who have worked in the old x-ray film archive describe especially at night sounds of a baby crying usually between the walls of the now fathers waiting room and the x-ray developer room. The building is now closed awaiting renovation to change it back to its former 827 design.
