Location: Riverside Cemetery

Description:
This cemetery next to the river is a very strange and eerie place, sensing the darkness and windy roads. Dark figures have been seen walking around and standing over graves and a few people have been attacked or approached by figures that refused to step into light. An Indian has also been seen out there, it is a place that you feel someone is watching you at all times. Being by the mausoleum is probably the best place to see or hear things or along the river bank.
