Description:
The Park at night can be a very scary place. The carousel turns on by itself in the middle of the night and is a mysterious maintenance worker who works on the Commet roller coaster. He was a victim of a freak accident at the roller coaster. It is also said that the ghost of Hershey himself roams the park to keep an eye on things.
