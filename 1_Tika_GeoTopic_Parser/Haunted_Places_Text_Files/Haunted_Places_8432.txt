Location: Hickory Springs

Description:
Information not known on incident happening in the late 1900's. The story says that if you are to walk behind the church there is a trail behind it leading into the woods. You may hear things running through the woods to meet you at the end of the trail. The objects will make odd noises like a panther. It's a really high-pitched scream that will send chills up your spine. Residents from miles away can hear the screams from all around the church. - December 2003 update; you can't go to Hickory Springs at night, because there is a no trespassing sign and cameras everywhere. If you trespass, you will be arrested. You can go there during the day though the groundskeeper will shoot Trespassers.
