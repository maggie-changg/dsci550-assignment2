Location: National Guard Armory

Description:
Reportedly there are doors that won't stay shut and that slam shut by themselves. People working there late at night have heard sounds of Horses and footsteps when there is no one there. A witness saw a reflection of a face of a man with a handle bar mustache in a computer screen and turned around to find no one there.
