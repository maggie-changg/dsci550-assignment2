Location: Community Counseling Consultants (Rehab center)

Description:
Lights turning themselves on and off... faucets on and off. Doors shutting themselves and opening themselves. A definite feeling that you are being watched in one of the rooms and the cold touches that are commonly felt with hauntings.
