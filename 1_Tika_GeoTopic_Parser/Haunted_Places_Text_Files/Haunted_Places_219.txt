Location: Castle Park

Description:
According to legend, this castle was built in 1890 by Michael Schwarz in order to properly seclude his family from, "America's uncivilising influences." Despite his attempts to keep his daughters secluded, one of them fell in love with a local Dutch boy, with whom she ran away to elope with. Schwarz interfered with the attempted elopement and locked his daughter away in the castle's tower. Reports claim that on moonlit nights, her ghost can be seen in the tower window looking towards Holland for her lost love.
