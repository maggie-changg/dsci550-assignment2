Description:
March 2005 Update/Correction: This has been boarded up due to vandalism. It is also belived this is turning into an urben legend. There is no proof of any certain trauma at this this place.- All the windows and doors on ground level are cemented up, so you cannot enter the building, and there are no stairs inside. On some nights you can see a girl about 15-18yrs old sitting on the ledge of the middle top window wearing a light blue dress. If you look up at her a feeling of sadness comes over you and your eyes get a little teary.
