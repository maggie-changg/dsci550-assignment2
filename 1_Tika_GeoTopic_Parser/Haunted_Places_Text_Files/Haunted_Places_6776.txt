Location: Crown Point High School

Description:
Reports that at night the lights go on and off in the gym, and the basketball cart moves out from the office, and the balls bounce on the floor, making a tremendous noise, since it has a wood floor, when someone comes, it disappears. The high school auditoriumâ€™s catwalks are supposedly haunted by a spirit. Students have reported hearing strange noises and seeing images of people walking along them. - September 2005 Update: Was torn down last year.
