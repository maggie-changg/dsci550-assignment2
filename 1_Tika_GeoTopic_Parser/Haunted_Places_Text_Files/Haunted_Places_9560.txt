Cold spots and shuffling sounds were heard on the 3rd floor. 230am the police responded to check out a possible burglary there and the 1st officer there saw some one in a window, they set up a perimeter around the building. They went in and did a room-to-room search and found nothing. Most of the Veteran officers say its haunted.
