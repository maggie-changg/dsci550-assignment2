Reports that there has been people seeing the two ghosts of the Renfrew sisters ghosts with bloody heads that were looking for their scalps. They were killed washing clothes at the creek and two Indians had come up to get their scalps. The two were buried in the old cemetery of Waynesboro and had unmarked graves. The Renfrew's house is still standing today and along with both with their barn and garden.
