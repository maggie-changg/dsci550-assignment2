Location: Dead Mans Run

Description:
word has it that around 1890 a man was working on the railroad tracks that were being laid through town. About 2 miles off of 19 on hwy. 11 to the right on a little black top road is a desolate patch of railroad tracks. Now this man who was working on it was having a bad time with his wife. So one night he took her out there for a "romantic interlude" and instead he beat her badly and tied her to the tracks. Well, thinking she was unconscious he sat down beside her to rest and without him knowing, she tied his boot laces to the track. He felt so guilty that he sat there on the tracks and never moved until he saw the train barreling down on him. When it was almost there he got up to move and couldn't. he looked down to see his wife grinning up at him and his laces tied in multiple knots. He tried to untie his laces, but to no prevail, and was killed with his wife on the tracks. Now if you go to those tracks on November 12 at about 2 to 3 am you can get out of your car and sit on the tracks and you will witness the entire scene. You can hear the man screaming and the woman laughing.
