Location: Sunset

Description:
Beach-Woods-"Uncle Milt's Place" - a grave stone. Lots of orbs and white mists. A demon dog at one part of the woods will give chase. It was a Boy's Camp. Now it's an abandoned ghost town. With lots of cellar holes. At one part of the woods you can get really lost like a maze where nothing looks familiar. Once there was grave stones in there but people took them like a long time ago. You can hear growling. And be careful of quick sand
