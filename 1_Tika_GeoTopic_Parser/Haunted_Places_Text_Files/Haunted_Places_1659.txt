Location: Rutland heights hospital

Description:
noises heard in halls. areas in hallway where there are unexplained "cold spots" employees that fell to there death off the water tower at Rutland Heights. The 88 acres was closed in 1991, leaving 17 buildings (which are full of asbestos and lead paint). Last time the submitter ventured here was on Halloween, they report human feces on the stairs (each of about 10 steps had a pile of human feces on it.) One of their fellow explorers fell about knee deep through the 4th floor. Overall, not a very safe place to go to. - February 2007 Update: Rutland has been demolished. All that's left is a flagpole and an old well. No activity since has been reported
