Location: Phoenix Hill Tavern

Description:
Footsteps coming down the stairs and across the Saloon. White-colored flashes in mirrors. Taproom area is extremely old, and has cold spots in air when otherwise warm. Objects get moved, disappear for a while, then show back up in the same place. All this happens when no one else is around to have caused it.
