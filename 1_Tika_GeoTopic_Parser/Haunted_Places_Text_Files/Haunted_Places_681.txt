Location: Becky's Grave

Description:
Supposedly a young lass, Becky by name, was labeled as a witch because she befriended an Indian in the early 1800's, as he taught her the ways of herbs and incantations in place of medicine not readily available at this time and place. It has been noted that your car may have trouble starting should you park in the lane leading to the old family cemetery. Also, it has been noted that on full moon nights, a shadowy figure has been seen rising from the gravesite of a WWII soldier while a west wind blows.
