Location: trestle bridge

Description:
there was the lady who walked theses train tracks and while she was walking over the bridge a train was coming, so she had two choices either to jump and kill herself or get hit by the train and die. Well she got hit by the train and died. If you go to the bridge day or night it doesnâ€™t matter, you can hear footsteps coming from the top from the bridge and you can even hear her scream. Cold spots and fog have been reported on the bridge, but when you get off the bridge there is nothing but the bridge.
