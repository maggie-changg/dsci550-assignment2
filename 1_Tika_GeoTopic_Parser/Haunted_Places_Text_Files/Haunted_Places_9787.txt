Location: South East Missouri State University

Description:
Cheney Hall - is said to be haunted. Around finals time, a girl living on the third floor couldn't handle the stress and committed suicide in her bathtub. It is said that no matter how hard they scrubbed, the blood would not come out of the tub. Instead of pulling the bathtub out and replacing it, they just built a shelf over it. Now, strange noises are heard in that room, and the door has a habit of slamming by itself when left open.
