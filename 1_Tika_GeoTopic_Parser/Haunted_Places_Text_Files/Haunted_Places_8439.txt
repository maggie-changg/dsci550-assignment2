Location: Blue Hole

Description:
Around Christmas in the post civil war years of the 19th century, a stagecoach was making its run from Varnell to Ringold when a sinkhole opened in its path. Horses, carriage and passengers disappeared into the water. During the same time of year a phantom coach can be seen barreling towards the blue hole and disappear at its verge. Located off of highway 2 north of Varnell. You have to hike to it on the old federal road.
