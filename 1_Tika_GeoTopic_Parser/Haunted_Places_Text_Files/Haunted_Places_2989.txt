Location: Downtown Baptist Educational Building (now leased off)

Description:
When the building was still a church educational building, there was a large set of stairways in the back from the top floor(#3), down to the basement. In the back of the building, there is a playground. A little girl was running down the steps to get to the playground, when she tripped, fell down one flight and broke her neck. You get a very eerie feeling going down the back stairs and you feel like someone is watching you.
