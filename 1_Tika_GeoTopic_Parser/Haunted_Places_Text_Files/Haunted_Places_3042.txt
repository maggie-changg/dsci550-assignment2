Location: Lansdowne (English Consul)

Description:
The area formerly known as "English Consul" (now Lansdowne) is a very big place for haunted activity. An old Mansion that sits atop a hill from the 1700's is the center of the activity. Lansdowne was once a plantation for an apple orchard. The mansion's garage was once a slave house, also, a tree not far from the mansion was used to tie slaves, (and as legend would have it the English consul's brother) and beat them. And to this day residents still see a glimpse of someone tied to the tree.
