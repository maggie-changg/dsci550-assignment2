Location: Young Harris College

Description:
Clegg Fine Arts Building â€“ Clegg Auditorium - It is common knowledge over the campus that Charlie Clegg, the president of the college in the 1960's, haunts the entire fine arts building. Even the professors acknowledge his presence by saying, "Goodnight, Charlie," when exiting the building for the night. Charlie has been known to play the organ downstairs at night, appear on stage, find lost props minutes before the actor has to appear on stage, whisper lines to actors who draw a blank, and even touch a few people from time to time. Although benevolent and helpful, he often frightens people to the point that they will not enter the auditorium alone.
