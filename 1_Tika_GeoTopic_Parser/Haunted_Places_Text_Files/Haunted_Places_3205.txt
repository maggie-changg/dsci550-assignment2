Location: Blanchard Cemetery

Description:
You walk in and you come to the second section of the cemetery and there will be three trees int he middle of the second section go to the left side of the section and you are more than likely to see a tall figure of a man with black pants and mostly what you can see is his hands and his pants, there is no logical explanation for this figure no shadows etc. because we checked it out with our vans lights nothing there, the figure also waves. Also there was a light that got bright and then slowly dimmed.
