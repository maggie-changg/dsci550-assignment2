Location: Southern Virginia College

Description:
This college is supposedly haunted by the ghost of a young boy who died here. He is said to haunt the fourth floor, which is one of the womenâ€™s dormitories. The ghost can sometimes be heard riding his bicycle up and down the hallway. There has also been an unusual death every year since the college was built. - October 2007 Update: The little boy that haunts the fourth floor also carries a red balloon as he's riding his tricycle, His Mother haunts the 3rd floor searching for him. She's in the 3rd floor bathroom a lot crying out for him.
