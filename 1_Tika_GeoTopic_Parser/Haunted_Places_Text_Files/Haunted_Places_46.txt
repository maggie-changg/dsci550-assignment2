Location: Dawnshire Park

Description:
Back in the early 90's there was a rumor heard of a man with a ax walking around in the woods and every time a kid from the neighborhood walked into the woods they would see him for a split second but then the face disappeared it was said that someone actually got it on video tape but now you only see it during a full moon you can see an extra shadow walking besides you with a man and a axe.
