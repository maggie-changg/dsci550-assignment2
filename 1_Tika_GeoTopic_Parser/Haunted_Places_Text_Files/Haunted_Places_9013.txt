Description:
The zoo is home to more than just the exotic animals. the elephant keeper was crushed and killed in the elephant yard in the 1980s, is still seen near the elephant and zebra areas of the zoo. There is a woman who is dressed in a white dress and carries a parasol; walks slowly back and forth near the spot where the zoo cafe is. She dresses in attire from the late 19th century and no one knows who she is.
