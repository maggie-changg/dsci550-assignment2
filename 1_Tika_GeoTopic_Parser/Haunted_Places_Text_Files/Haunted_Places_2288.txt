Location: Tryon Creek State Park

Description:
When the conditions are right, generally right before a major storm, if you are out along the North Rim Trail you will hear the sound of horses in harness and smell fresh cut timber, even though the last time the area was logged was in the late 1800's. Down by the creek you can hear in the early morning, the sound of men getting ready for a day of work in the woods.
