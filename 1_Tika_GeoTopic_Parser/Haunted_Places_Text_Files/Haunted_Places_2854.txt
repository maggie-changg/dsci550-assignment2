Location: Venice

Description:
Venice high school - it has been said that auditorium lights and sound turn on by themselves sometimes while events are taking place also screams being heard in the control room also the place gets very cold sometimes the auditorium and the school itself has a long past history of many events and the decor itself of the auditorium is very eerie old style just a weird feeling when you walk in there when empty it has been said that in fact there is an entity haunting the place.
