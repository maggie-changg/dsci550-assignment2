Location: Keys Crossing

Description:
by the River at nightstands three ghosts on the edge of the bank on their knees throwing roses. Probably because they lost a family member, and everybody that goes down there at night has to drive real slow or they will flip exactly 3 times at die or get severely injured and people say it is cursed by the Indians. When you just go down the road you see shadowy figures staring at you.
