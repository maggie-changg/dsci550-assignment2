Location: Kehoe House Bed &amp; Breakfast

Description:
Said to be haunted by the spirits of children. Also, by a "Lady in Gray" who haunts not only the bed & breakfast in general, but particularly room #203. People who have stayed in this room have felt their hands being gently touched and have felt kisses upon their cheeks. All have agreed that she seems to be a very friendly spirit.
