Location: Anna Maria College

Description:
The ghost of a young woman is said to haunt the theater here. A human skeleton was found under the stage, presumably hers. Plays with the lights, lets a few people see her sitting in the seats, and seems to have a fascination with modern technology. - July 2005 Update:The ghost in the theater is believed to be named Theresa.
