The story goes that when the American Indians roams the hills of East Texas they were being massacred by the white man. The chief learned of a planned attack and had separated the women and children from the his men. The white man planned for the split and killed the chief and his men by the huge trees by the bridge. The women and children were slaughtered right by the bridge. There are a couple of trees that are still there and with the leaves & branches are shaped like a Chief's head gear with the shape of a face. If you go to the bridge at night and turn your engine off right on top of the bridge, roll your windows down, you can still hear the cries of the women and children that were massacred.
