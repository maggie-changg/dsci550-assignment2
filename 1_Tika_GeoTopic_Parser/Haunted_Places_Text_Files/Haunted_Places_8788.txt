Location: River Legacy Park

Description:
Hells Gate - It is a long trail with swamps on either side and shaded over by large trees. At the end of the trail is a large mound of dirt and two fence posts that were once a gate. As it is said this was the trail walked by captured spies of the union army on there way to be hung. This gate was the last thing they saw before being led to the tree that stands beyond the gate where they died. Walking the trail one can still hear the sobs and whispered prayers of the men and some women who walked there last steps here.
