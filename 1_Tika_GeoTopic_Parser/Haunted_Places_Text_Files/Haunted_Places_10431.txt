Location: Billy's Bar &amp; Grill

Description:
It is rumored that this now local bar at one time was a whore house. Not to the liking of the owner at the time she was over powered by her male employees and was unable to keep the establishment a simple tavern for the traveling loggers working on the nearby Rum River. She died up stairs in one of the bedrooms not to soon after the uprising. To this day several people (patrons & employees) have noticed tables set in the morning when arriving to work, pictures on the wall moved around, and simple cleaning tasks done when no one had actually done them. The old maid has also been seen in the bar and restaurant wandering aimlessly.
