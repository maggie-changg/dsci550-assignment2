Location: Mansfield Training Center

Description:
An abandoned asylum for the feeble minded or mentaly retarded. Part of it is apparently used for storage for old UCONN stuff but other parts have a very weird vibe to them. Many pictures have been taken with "orbs", especially outside and in the basement.
