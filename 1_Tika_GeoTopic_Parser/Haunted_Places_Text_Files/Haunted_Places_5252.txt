Location: Auchenba

Description:
it is very very haunted. In the 1st floor men’s room it is always 15 to 20 degrees cooler the rest of the building and you feel as if you are being watched. In the basement there is the old morgue and you can see bloody footprints on the floor, walls and ceiling. On the 3rd floor you will here a toilet flush with no one in the bathroom and the elevator runs up and down on it's own. You can also see the ghost of Charlie Auchenba. There are a number of cold spots and areas where you feel as though you are being watched. You can also see the shadow of a person standing on the ledge in several of the rooms on 3rd floor. I would warn people about going there now cause it was sold and the guy that owns it WILL call the cops on you if you are caught trespassing. However, if you can get permission to check it out it is well worth it.
