Location: Bethel Cemetery

Description:
Bethel Cemetery is a historical cemetery established in 1853. The location is just east of Moore Road just north of Beltline. There is a grave that was supposed to be haunted. It is marked with odd symbols. Apparently, the gravesite does not like its picture being taken because the submitter went through a roll of Polaroid instant film with every picture of the headstone overexposed. Only one picture was normal...a picture of the landscape away from the gravestone.
