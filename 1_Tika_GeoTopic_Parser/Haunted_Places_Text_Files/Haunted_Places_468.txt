Location: Hoosier Valley

Description:
People who live down in Hoosier Valley have seen a man walking around at night dragging chains behind him. One time residents of a house down there walked outside and saw him standing behind a pine tree in their front yard. They went inside and the next morning they went out to the tree and the tree had been cut down and there was no sign of the man. It is said that if you go outside at night you can hear him walking around in the woods dragging his chains.
