Location: Roseville Prison

Description:
The old abandoned Prison in Roseville, just south of Zanesville and East of Columbus is rumored to be haunted. On some nights it is said that the ghost of a woman dressed in white can be seen falling from the roof of the building in a re-enactment of her suicide. Also, ghostly shadowy images are said to be seen peering out of the guard tower.
