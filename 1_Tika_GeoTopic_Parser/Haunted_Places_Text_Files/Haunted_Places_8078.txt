Description:
Charles A. Dana Hall of Science - It's said that people in the labs late at night have turned around to find a pitch-black, shadowy figure standing in the doorway. In addition, the cause of a mysterious false fire alarm causing the sprinklers to come on and flood the building in the summer of 1999 remains unexplained. Many say it was an angry or mischievous ghost.
