Location: The Old Slave House

Description:
!!!WARNING!!! Was once a tourist attraction for history buffs and ghost hunters alike. The house was sold to new owners in 1994 and they do not give tours. They do not want guest and they do not want anyone near the property. they will call the police on trespassers. - the story of the Slave house is, the owner built the house to breed slaves and sell them down south. He had many studs, his most famous was named Big Jim. All of the Slaves, including Big Jim were kept chained in little rooms in the attic. Slavery was Illegal in IL, so the owner has a side entrance built on to the house that a wagon could pull up to and a person or persons could be taken into the house and up to attic without being seen. Some of his victims were free blacks that he kidnapped and held captured until they were sold down south when was done breading them. To this day the attic still has the little stalls with the chains on the wall and floor. You can hear the moaning and crying of the slaves. Some reported seeing Big Jim in the Attic and other places in the house. There is a lot of activity in the house. The owners would give tours and even let people spend the nightin the attic. It is said no one has ever been able to stay till dawn in that attic. A few TV crews, ghost hunters and psychics have tried and failed.
