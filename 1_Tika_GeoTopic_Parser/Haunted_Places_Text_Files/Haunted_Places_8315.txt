Location: The Warren House

Description:
The Warren House was used as a hospital during the Civil War. While at the house many soldiers carved their names in the wall. At night a figure of a soldier can be seen holding a candle and looking out the window. There have been several reports of this. There is supposedly a bloodstain still on the floor in the attic. The confederate cemetery across the street is said to be haunted as well.
