Location: Wyoming Territorial Prison

Description:
This Prison, built in the late 1800's, is inhabited by the resident ghost Julius Greenwelch.  He only makes himself know with a group less then four people and when people are TRYING to sleep.  Only a few have seen him in complete form without any devices.
