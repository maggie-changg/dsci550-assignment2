Location: The Hangin' Tree

Description:
This location is so notorious as to be completely abandoned at night save the most curious. This tree was reportedly used for numerous lynchings and is currently surrounded by a small community that has been in this area since pre-antebellum. Reported that bodies can be seen in the tree from a distance and if it is approached, the swaying bodies will stare at the trespassers. Other sightings conclude that there is a murder of crows that constantly watch for trespassers as well.
