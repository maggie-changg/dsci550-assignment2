Location: Tapatio Cliffs

Description:
The Point Hiton - The main ballroom is haunted by a drunken man who, when at a wedding reception some twenty years ago, reportedly walked up to the cliffs right behind the ballroom, and fell head first. As told by a couple of security guards there, he haunts the boiler room, and no one is allowed down there after midnight.
