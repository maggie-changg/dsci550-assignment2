Location: Whitepath

Description:
The northern region of Gilmer County, called Whitepath, is named after the Cherokee chief who once inhabited it. Whitepath cursed any future owners of the land as he and his people were moved out on the "Trail of Tears." A hotel built on the site burned to the ground in the early part of the 20th century, killing many, after the hotel itself had been home to several murders and suicides. The sounds of revelry and the sounds of screams and moans of suffering can still be heard often at the site of the hotel, which is now only marked by an overgrown driveway and its broken concrete archway. Chief Whitepath's own ghost haunts and has appeared at the nearby area where his own house once stood.
