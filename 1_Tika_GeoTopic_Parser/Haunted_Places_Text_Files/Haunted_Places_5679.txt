Location: Pine Bush

Description:
Montgomery - Hill Avenue Cemetery - when we were children and visited this cemetery, there was always a man who wondered where his glowing balls were. to this day it still seems like it was just a dream. but as reported by many, as you drive the dark slopes of hill ave., between the twilight hours, there can be seen a man walking with two empty leashes saying, "have you seen my balls? i can't find my balls!"
