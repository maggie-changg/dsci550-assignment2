Location: Fitzgerald Community Ed Building

Description:
This building used to be the site of Family Youth Interventions and before that was a convent. It is said that the nuns haunt the building. Metal fire doors rattle on the second floor, and when you are on the first floor you can hear footsteps above you when no one is upstairs.
