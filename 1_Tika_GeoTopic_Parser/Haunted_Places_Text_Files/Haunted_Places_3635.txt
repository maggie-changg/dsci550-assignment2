Location: Cry Baby Bridge

Description:
Legend has it that one foggy night a very long time ago, there was a war going on. This woman had a baby and men were chasing her to kill her child, so she threw the baby in this little creek and the baby died. Now if you go over the bridge and leave an unwrapped candy bar, turn around and it will be gone. Some people say they can hear a baby crying, and sometimes you may even look into the water and see the shadow of a baby.
