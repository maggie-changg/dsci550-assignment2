Description:
Old timers tell of a haunting on 9 Mile Ridge Road. They say at certain times, if you are out there at night, you will see a man walking with a lantern. Some say it is unknown who he is. Others tell that it is a man who searched and hoped for his son to return from the Civil War, and watches over the ridge.
