Description:
David dorm -  is haunted by Indians. When the dorm was built in the 1970s, bones were found. When the remains were turned in, they dated back to the early 1700s, and maps showed that the land was owned by local Indians. Concordia was given the ok to keep building there, but they had to turn in all of the remains that were found. Residents have reported blow dryers, computers, curling irons, phones and other electronics that will turn on, or the shower will turn on. Some say the Indians are angry that Concordia was allowed to build there. Students have reported strange happenings since 1976.
