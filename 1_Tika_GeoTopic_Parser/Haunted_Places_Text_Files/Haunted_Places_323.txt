Location: Central Michigan University

Description:
Carlin Alumni House - The Alumni house is the former residence of University Presidents. People working in the basement hear heavy footsteps walking up and down the hallways, toilets flush for no reason and there has been unexplained pounding coming from inside the basement walls. Each night employees yell up the stairs to make sure no one is in the building and twice their yell of " Any one up there??" has been answered by the ghost. Once two employees heard a man's deep laugh when closing down the building for the night and another two experienced footsteps running toward them down a stairway. Another night an employee was setting the alarm and he looked down a hallway and saw a giant white streak soar across from one office to the next.
