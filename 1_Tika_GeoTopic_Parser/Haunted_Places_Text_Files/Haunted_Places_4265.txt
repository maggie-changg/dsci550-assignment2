Description:
Screaming Bridge -  The Screaming Bridge is located on Maud-Hughes Road in Liberty Twp. The Bridge is about 25ft above the Railroad tracks and was part of the old line C.C.C. and St. Louis back in the late 1800's and at the turn of the century it became New York Central Freight around 1900. On Sunday morning Oct 24th 1909 an Freight Train was traveling northbound from Union Twp "which is to the south" when 2 engineers where scalded to death when the steam train boiler blew. They say to this day reports of the dead trainmen in black walk the tracks between the Screaming Bridge to Gano. The bridge is a common place for car accidents as well as suicides over the years. To this day at least 36 reported people have lost their lives on or near the bridge. Ghostly figures are commonly seen on film with 110 400 speed or 35mm b/w or color 400 speed film. Other ghostly lights and spirit energy are commonly reported on film too. The rarely seen Invisible Bridge and train may be also captured on film too. Other things not as commonly are ghostly fogs appearing on the tracks below "even that you seen no fog on the tracks as you took the pic" Black hooded figures are also seen. Another story is that a bus driver lost control of the bus and all the children in it died. If you are coming up the road, there is a sign that says "school bus stop ahead." And if you drive across the bridge, it sounds like children are screaming. Another is there was a murder near that bridge also. And if you park on the bridge, turn your car off, roll your windows down and flash your lights three times, you will see a man with an axe walking toward your car. And yet another is of a woman threw her baby off the bridge and hung herself afterwards. People go there in the middle of the night and say they hear screams.
