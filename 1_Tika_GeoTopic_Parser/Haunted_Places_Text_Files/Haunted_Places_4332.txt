Location: Main Street

Description:
A farmhouse dating back to the mid-1800s, now refurbished and occupied by ClinCon Research. Haunted by young girl in a white dress. A 19-century farmer living in the house often saw the girl staring at him, and sometimes crying, through a window. His dog refused to go in the room where the girl most often appeared. Finally he locked his dog in the room, and the dog chewed and clawed his way almost all the way through the door to get out. The farmer once confronted the girl in a hallway, but when she turned towards him, she had no face. Recent incidents include unexplained movement of furniture. Many old buildings along Main St., including the Public House Inn, are haunted.
