Location: Paris

Description:
The Green Lantern - There is an unexplainable light that passes down the road that gets closer and closer and then mysteriously disappears. Go down Mesceola Rd, located between Reed City and Paris. Then turn left down the first road. Go down to the end of the road and turn around at the stop sign. Stop on the third hill and turn off the car. Keep very quiet. The light sometimes even passes through the car, then disappears.
