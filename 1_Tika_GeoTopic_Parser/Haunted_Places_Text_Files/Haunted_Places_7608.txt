Location: Forest Service Building

Description:
there was a very old house on the site where the present day forest service building is. Witnesses heard footsteps, a voice singing, and someone speaking in a foreign language. Also reports of a shadow of something that walked right in front of them. It was darker than the room they were in. 1 witness swears that someone pulled his hair. Rumors that numerous Chinese slave laborers had been killed in the old days of the railroad being put into the area.
