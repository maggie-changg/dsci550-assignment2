Location: Upattinas School

Description:
this alternative school used to be a home for wayward boys in the 1960's. There have been sightings of a pair of legs, and a man wearing a pink shirt and khakis in the stone hallway of the lower school. Basketballs roll across the gym by themselves. There was a person killed in the shower in the bathroom and a student went in there and her nose started bleeding. As soon as she left, it stopped. In the Photography Darkroom, strange things have happened. Like markers fly through the air and doors open and close, radio stations always change to the same country station, and the water overflows in the sink and floods the floor. Last year, a student fell asleep in the lounge, and the gates were locked at the end of school. He was locked in the upstairs of the gym building overnight with no cell phone to call anyone. He figured he’d be fine and he’d just continue sleeping in the lounge, but he couldn’t stand it because he kept hearing footsteps walking up and down the hallway. When kids arrived at school the next day, they saw the student asleep at the bottom of the steps right behind the gate. He said that’s the only place that he couldn’t hear the footsteps.
