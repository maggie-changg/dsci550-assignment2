Location: Dorr House

Description:
There is a floor to ceiling mirror in the 'Formal' sitting room... when a female visitor stands in its sights, if they have on a short skirt, they report feeling a 'tugging' as if someone is trying to make the skirt longer. Many visitors and guides have reported smelling Roses (fresh cut) at intervals followed by an EXTREMELY COLD spot. Roses were Mrs. Dorrâ€™s favorite flower. Visitors have reported hearing soft crying coming from the sick room/sewing room. A word of warning to all who visit, MIND YOUR MANNERS... Mrs. Dorr doesn't allow rudeness and has been known to 'make sure' the perpetrator doesn't stay or wants to leave posthaste. This ex-Docent has seen first hand that Mrs. Dorr is still the 'LADY' of the house.
