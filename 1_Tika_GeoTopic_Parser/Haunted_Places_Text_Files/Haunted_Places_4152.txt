Location: Normandy High School

Description:
The cheerleaders were hazing the new recruits in the 80's when a tile from the gym ceiling fell and struck one of the girls in the head killing her. The cheerleaders didn't want to get in trouble so they threw her body in the woods behind the baseball diamonds. It is said that if you walk in the woods late and night, you can still hear her practicing her cheers.
