Location: Greenwood Cemetery

Description:
Long ago at a lake across from the cemetery, a wealthy family lived in a large house. The wife was stricken with an illness and had to be put in a wheelchair. Her husband fell in love with another woman and pushed his wife into the lake killing her. Some nights she can be seen as a green mist hovering above the ground and there will be wheelchair tracks on the ground.
