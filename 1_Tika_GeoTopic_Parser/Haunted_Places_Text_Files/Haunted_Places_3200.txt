Location: Jessie Creek Cemetery

Description:
Outside of Bartlesville, near the infamous "haunted hill" and Circle Mountain there is an old abandon cemetery off County Road 2700. The cemetery sits in an open field/space next to a small, abandon lawn and landscape business. It's hard to spot the cemetery driving past because it sits off into the edge of the woods and is so overgrown that it takes a good eye to see it though the forest. Electrical problems have been reported with digital cameras
