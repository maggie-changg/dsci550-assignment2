Location: Society of Divine Savior Seminary

Description:
US headquarters for Catholic mystic cult which was forced to flee Germany in the 19th century because of its secret practices. Hotbed of pedophilia, closeted homosexual love triangles, suicide, fraud, incest and even an exorcism! The patron cult leader Father Oschwald is kept in a crypt on the grounds. His followers are buried in front of his crypt. Their graves are alternately sinking and rising. Oswald is known to wander the forested perimeter of the eutrophied Lake Oswald on a white horse. His followers wander the grounds moaning. The decayed buildings are known to be haunted by the screams of the tortured souls who've spent time there. In addition, they are infested with all manner of pests including many active wasp, hornet and bee hives. Much of the village was severely damaged in a freak storm in 2000. Locals uneasily murmur about the 'Wrath of Oswald' and his fury with the townsfolk who've abandoned him...
