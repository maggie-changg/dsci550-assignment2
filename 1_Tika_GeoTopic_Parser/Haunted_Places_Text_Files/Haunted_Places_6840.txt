Location: Mount Thabor Cemetery

Description:
Red, green, and white glowing balls of light have appeared in photographs taken at this fairly isolated old cemetery. Erie shadows are also seen fluttering about the cemetery at night amongst a mass of green mist which sometimes engulfs the graveyard. Motorists passing this cemetery at night have often seen balls of light floating towards the road.
