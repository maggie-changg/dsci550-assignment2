Description:
An eleven year old girl, whose last name is Sloane died from a disease in a hotel room there. The building on the right, which is right next to Sloane's Tavern. A open diner place. They say people have heard squeaks, as apposed to be her own language. Even my dad did. He works as a carpenter there.
