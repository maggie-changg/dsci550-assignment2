Location: Lone Tree Cemetery

Description:
Faces have been seen in the bushes. Strange noises heard inside the graveyard. Things have been moved from headstones to unexplainable places. Whispering and thumps heard when walking through the main part of the cemetery. Lights flash and bells chime. Strange movements and dark shadows in the distance. A few orbs have been seen with the naked eye. Many came out on the camera. Strange noises heard on the video when played back.
