Location: Winona State College

Description:
Lourdes Hall - 3rd floor - Every one knows about the ghost on the 4th floor at Lourdes but the third floor is also haunted. People have had things taken off the wall, pictures knocked over and turned around, and posters moved from their hanging position and moved to the other side of the room on the floor. Doors will close and lock by themselves and you can hear people in the halls when no one is there
