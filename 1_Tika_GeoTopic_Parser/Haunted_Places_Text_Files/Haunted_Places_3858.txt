Location: Brooklyn High School

Description:
In the high school's auditorium there is a believed ghost named Clarence. Before concerts & plays someone must ask the ghost's permission to use the auditorium. If someone does not ask permission many things go wrong. One year during a musical play performance all lights went out except the house lights. After the audience had left it was determined that nothing at all was wrong with the lights, then they came back on. It is rumored that Clarence was on the second level in the auditorium and fell off and died.
