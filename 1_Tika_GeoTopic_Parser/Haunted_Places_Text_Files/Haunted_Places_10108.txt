Description:
Doner Auditorium - A man that was a janitor in 1919, fell out of an alcove above the stage where an organ was located. The organ would randomly play for two years following his death until it was dismantled and scrapped. He causes a lot of electrical and technical problems if a specific prop is moved from the prop room, and also he's been seen as recently as 10/20/01... He doesn't seem to be lost, an authentic haunting, as he will react to words and waving. He's a wonderful spirit, but likes to cause trouble.
