Location: Summer Cut Bridge

Description:
Legend has it that a woman's car went off this bridge on a rainy night and she died. Late at night on a rainy night if you go down on the train tracks where her car landed and stand there in the darkness, you can see her walking down the train tracks in a white dress.
