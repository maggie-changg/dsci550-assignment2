Location: streets around Eagle Ave. &amp; the Train Tracks

Description:
there have been multiple sightings by locals. Most are at the train station. a floating blue/white light which looks like an old man. Is seen "walking" slowly across the tracks. when he is across he turns back looks and dissipates. Others have seen the old man walking in front of there houses in every case the man looks at the onlooker then dissipates. The neighborhood dogs wont even go out side at times and in some rare cases when people noticed that there dogs wouldn't even come into different rooms in there houses they have reported seeing the man in there house. But that is rare and only two people have seen this. Some people don't see the man but here a voice whisper "come here."
