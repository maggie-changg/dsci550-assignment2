Location: Suguaro Ranch Park

Description:
Haunting 18th Century. There is a woman that lives within the back of the Ranger House. Adjacent to the Park Ranger house is an old ranch style room. We took a picture and have found that the Ranch House is haunted. There is a woman that still haunts the house, and it appears it is relation to the Smith family.
