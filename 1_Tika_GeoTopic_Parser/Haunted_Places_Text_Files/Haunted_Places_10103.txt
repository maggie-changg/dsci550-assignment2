Location: Dead President's Tavern

Description:
This tavern is a very old building (200 years or so) and has had many waiters/waitresses complain of dishes being thrown at them, screaming, dominoes floating from the game boards in the recreation room, and other poltergeis-like incidents and activity, all supposedly related to the ghost of a former customer who was a big prankster (circa 1950's) named lemonade Mullery, who ended up having the last laugh as he slipped in a puddle of urine in the men's room and broke his neck in the late 60's. An odd but true tale, and a strange presence can fairly easily be felt in Dead President's, even by non-psychic individuals.
