Location: Barat College

Description:
The school is going to be 100 years old this year and there have so many ghost sightings there that you could write a whole book about it. Apparitions that have been seen include 3 children (2 girls and 1 boy), Nuns (not sure how many, but the school used to be Catholic and the Nuns used to live on campus) a groundskeeper and various others. A large majority of students have seen or heard unexplainable phenomena
