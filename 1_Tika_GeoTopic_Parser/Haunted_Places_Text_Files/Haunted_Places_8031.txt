Location: Sandy

Description:
Liberty Heights - 4 years ago, this apartment building had a pool where a playground is now built. A little boy went swimming by himself with no supervision. He drowned, and was found a couple hours later. It is said if you go to the playground by yourself you'll feel a cold presence. Swings move by themselves. and if you dig in the woodchips, puddles of water float to the surface.
