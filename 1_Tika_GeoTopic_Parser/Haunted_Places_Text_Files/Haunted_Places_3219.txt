Description:
6 miles east of Catoosa on highway 412 sets a small community cemetery. the cemetery sets on the edge of an area known to local residents as haunted hallow. It is said in 1989 a young Indian boy was struck by a car while sopped on the road on his bike. he was buried in the cemetery on the first row in the gate. the gate sits at the bottom of the hill and since 1993 drivers have claimed as they came over the hill spotting a young boy kneeling next to a bike. some have swerved to miss him and others distinctly hear the sound of the car striking something but when they inspect the rode no body is found. some claim to even spotted bloody hand prints on the fenders. And Catoosa police department have on file several reports of drivers saying they struck a boy on a bicycle in front of the cemetery gate and even photos of minor damage to the cars but no body has ever been found. also several teenagers trespassing on the wooded lot in front of the cemetery have claimed to have sudden nose bleeds and spot glowing objects above the graves...it is rumored that the cemetery gate has been seen by the caretaker to open itself and several have quit....
