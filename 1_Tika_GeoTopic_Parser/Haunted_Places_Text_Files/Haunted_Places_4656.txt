Location: Perkinsville Dr.

Description:
When turning at the Hardies intersection in Boone near Lowes Foods, Go to the second road on the right, just past the gas station. The road is Perkinsville drive, follow the road to the last house on the left, you have to look hard. The house is hidden by trees and over growth. This house is so haunted, you're guaranteed to experience something every time you go, day or night. Supposedly a man died due to un-natural causes and haunts that house. Mostly footsteps are heard, a strong feeling of non-welcome, and an angry banging on the up stairs floor. - December 2003 Update: Has burnt down
