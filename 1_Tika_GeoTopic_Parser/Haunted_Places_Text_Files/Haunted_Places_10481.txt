Location: Hibbing High School Auditorium

Description:
An apparition of an older male sitting in seat J47 has been photographed many times. It is thought to be the ghost of a stage manger, but this is untrue. There has always been an odd occurrence in the auditorium, but the rumor wasn't believed until the apparition was captured in the photograph after a play practice in 2000. -  October 2004 update: currently being investigated by Northern Minnisosta Paranormal Investigators. The origins of the ghost are still unknown.
