This Cemetery is very old.1700-1800s. There have been reports of a headless horseman chasing young girls. Animal bones lying around. Calls for help. Weird noises like someone knocking on a coffin. Babies crying. Children laughing. And a kick ball rolling around. Many of the people that died here were children of large families. The cemetery is very small only containing about 15 gravestones.
