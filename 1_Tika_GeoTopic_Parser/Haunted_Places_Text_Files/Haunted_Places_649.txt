Description:
Sightings of apparitions as well as ghostly sounds. - January 2004 addition: a former worker in the kitchen, claims that one night he ran down to the cellar to get ice out of the freezer, and as he was bent over he felt someone put their hand on his shoulder, he turned around to see who it was and there wasn't anyone there. He never ran so fast upstairs in his life. Also he saw with his own eyes a pregnant woman who worked there, was on the second floor collecting dirty dishes on a tray and proceeded to use the main steps to come downstairs. As she did so she tripped and the tray went flying to the bottom of the stairs and the dishes broke into a million pieces but many witnesses say the she did not fall. Something caught her in mid air and set her back down on the steps. there is also the story of the hat that keeps reappearing on the fireplace mantel, even though every night it gets locked in a closet when employees come in the next day its back out on the mantel.
