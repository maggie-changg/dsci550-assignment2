Location: Pendleton King Park

Description:
Small cemetery in the park belongs to the Bugg family. The park is the former site of the Bugg Plantation, purchased pre-1842 by Judge John P. King and donated to the city by his son, Henry King, upon his death. Reports have been made for years involving a white figure that darts in and out of the trees surrounding the brick walled cemetery, and in and out of the cemetery itself. There are also tales of a Camellia bush that grew beside the old mansion (now burned down), it would bloom profusely in warning of the coming death of one of the King family.
