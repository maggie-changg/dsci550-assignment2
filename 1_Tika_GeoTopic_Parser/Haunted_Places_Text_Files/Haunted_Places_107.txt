Location: Detroit Institute of Arts

Description:
There is a figure in the African Gallery called the nail figure. I work security in the museum and several officers who work the afternoon and midnight shift have reported that when the lights are out the nail figure has (an African Sculpture who is impaled with several shards of wood referred to as "nails") has been seen performing a tribal dance. In the American Gallery there have been several reports of loud crashes in a room which houses a painting called the court of death. A loud crash has been reported to be heard by several officers patrolling through this area in the dark, sounding like a painting falling (It is a very large painting). When the lights are turned on there are no painting or any artworks out of order.
