Description:
Old Main - Early one morning in the 1980's a fire destroyed a residence hall and gutted the attic of Old Main, a grand building used for administration offices and classrooms. A student was hiding in the attic to avoid the fire and was burned to death. Students have reported smelling burning flesh and hearing screams when in the attic during the morning. The smell has even been so bad that classes have been cancelled more than once to avoid it. - July 2005 Update/correction: In 1978 or 1979 a story appeared in the college newspaper about the reported ghost of a former professor that had reputedly hung himself from one of the rafters. A picture of the rope was shown still in place. The hanging reputedly took place in the 1920's. But, a picture of the classroom he reputedly taught in was untouched. All the desks and blackboard was in black n white. Very eerie. It was also a storage place for stage props when the theatre department was in operation until 1975 and only within the last 15 years or so was it restarted. The door to the fourth floor was found open on occasion but was supposed to be locked and occasional power outages occurred as well.
