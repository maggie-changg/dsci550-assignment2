Location: Adelaide

Description:
Adelaide cemetery - it's been said that a young woman walks the cemetery looking for her children. All of them died after first settling in the area. Her husband then died later. Supposedly every Friday night around midnight a glowing figure walks the cemetery crying out for her child, and after about 15 minutes vanishes into the darkness.
