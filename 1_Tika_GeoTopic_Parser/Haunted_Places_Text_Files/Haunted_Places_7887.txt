Location: Waialae Drive-in Theaters

Description:
Sights of a woman with long hair, no face and no lower half, accompanied with Doors slamming shut. - August 2004 update: (This theatre no longer exists. this may also be an urban legend. There's similar stories to this on the mainland as well. The submitter can recall one that involved a theatre, a teen aged couple, and a woman with no face.)
