Location: 13th Street Steak and Shake

Description:
Three people were murdered in the wee hours of the morning inside the walk-in freezer by a disgruntled employee. Current employees will not stay in there alone anytime of day or night. - March 2007 update: this location was closed late 2006 for re-building. The new building is almost finished and expected to open soon. - October 2007 Update: The Stake and Shake on 13th St. has been torn down and fully rebuilt for a grand opening of yet the same steak and shake. It is still under construction but it should be open sometime this year. No reports to why the owners felt the need to tear down the place only to rebuild it.
