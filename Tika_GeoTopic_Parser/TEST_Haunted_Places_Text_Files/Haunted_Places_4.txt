Description:
Kappa Delta Sorority - The Kappa Delta Sorority is haunted by an entity simply known as 'P'. It is said she was a sister there who died in a car accident. Current sisters there have reported hearing giggling and running around coming from the upstairs floor while they are in the basement. At one time a sister called out to "P" and received a "hello" in reply.
