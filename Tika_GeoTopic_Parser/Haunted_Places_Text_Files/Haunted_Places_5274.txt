Location: Stull Cemetery

Description:
is said to be a gateway to the afterlife. I have been there once. It is closed off and one risks an overnight stay in the Douglas county jail if they are caught trespassing. It is an old cemetery surrounding an abandoned church. Legend holds that any object thrown into the church regardless of what it is, you will never hear it hit the ground.
