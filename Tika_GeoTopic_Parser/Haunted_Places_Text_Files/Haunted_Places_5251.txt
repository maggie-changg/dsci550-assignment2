Description:
The Happy Seven - Back in the 50's 7 high school kids were out raising hell while driving drunk and drove over three treacherous hills that follow in a row. Each one getting steeper and steeper and on the last one they actually hit the side of it crushing there car into a very compact box! True story. The town’s police had the car put up on a high wooden platform on the side of the road at the exact spot they died, to teach the rest of the towns teenagers from making the same mistake. Thing is don't go messing around and try even though it’s a thrill ride, you will wreck or almost lose it and it's said if you try it. You can hear the young teenagers screaming. This is very dangerous, drive with caution.
