Description:
Trumbull County Campus - A man who worked there as a custodian. At night they would hear all kind of knocks and tapping noises. After checking everything in the building several times to make sure nothing mechanically was responsible for the noise, they were baffled. We were told that a medium was called in, who in turn told them that the campus had been built on what was formerly the grounds of an old folks home. The campus is haunted by people who passed away there. The noises heard are tapping of canes and walkers.
