Location: Loonis McGlohan Theatre (Spirit Square)

Description:
The original building in this location was constructed in the late 1800's, as a church. In 1903 it was rebuilt into the structure, which exists there today. The church was taken over by the city, in the 1940's or early 1950's, and renovated into a theatre. Now, almost 100 years later, you can hear people walking around in the Church/Theatre when the facility is closed. As well, a few of the employees have noted that sometimes when they are working in the sub-basement, they can hear faint singing coming from above them.
