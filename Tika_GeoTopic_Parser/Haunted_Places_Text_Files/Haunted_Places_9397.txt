Description:
Walsh-Ellet Hall - Witnesses have heard footsteps come up the staircase and continue into the corridor pause by the open door where I was studying--felt an odd chill--then the footsteps continued down the hall and down the staircase on the other side. In addition, there are two enclosed staircases on the exterior of Walsh-Ellet Building on the Quad and one is labeled 'UP' and the other is labeled 'Down' Many students have heard & seen the gownsman (different from the gownsman in the library. especially if they are going the 'wrong direction' on the stairs.
