Description:
Pell Hall - There are several occurrences on campus.  There was one student who lived in Pell Hall in the early 1900's.  She was going to sneak out of a window to meet her fiancée and go elope.  He swore that if she jumped, he would catch her.  He didn't catch her and now you can see a woman in a white dress running down the hallway to meet her lover. Also, there was a girl in the 1950's named Betty Payne.  She hanged herself off the door in her room.  The door has been repainted and replaced numerous times and no matter what, you can still see the outline of the rope, noose, and the outline of her body.  She is a fairly hostile ghost.  She has locked people in her room before.
