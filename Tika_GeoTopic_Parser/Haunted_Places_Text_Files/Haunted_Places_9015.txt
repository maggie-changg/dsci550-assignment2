Location: Log Cabin Village

Description:
When up in the top floor you can smell lilacs, people say that it is the perfume of a settler that was killed there. You can also hear doors slamming. Sometimes a evil spirit that resembles a man with a broken neck will scream and can be felt chasing you out of the building.
