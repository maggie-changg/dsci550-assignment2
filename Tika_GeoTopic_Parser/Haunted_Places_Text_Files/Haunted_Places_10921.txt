Location: Helmshire Inn

Description:
On the third floor a worker claims ghosts would undo their work after rooms had been tidied lot of times the curtains would be open again, one time a bed had been "unmade" and toilets would flush when nobody was on the floor with me. Also, the basement, in certain areas, seems to have a presence, it may not be the same one from the third floor. You should give Fort Collins another glance since this area was an intense battleground. Look back in some of the old newspapers. Especially areas near and around Legacy Park and Martinez Park.
