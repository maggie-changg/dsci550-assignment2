Location: Sorority Houses

Description:
A glowing "help me" can be read clearly on the ceiling of the treasurers bedroom and also the whistle of a past house mother who died in the house, can be heard. She would wear the whistle at Monday night dinner and blow it to give a lesson in etiquette...we can still hear the whistle being blown in the house.
