Location: Ulster County Greenfield

Description:
Greenfield Rd - In mid 1980s Greenfield Rd, near what appears to be a small pond at the T intersection where a paved road leads toward Route 52 two ghosts were sighted. Both dressed in 1800s era clothes. Both blonde children looked like siblings a boy about 10 year old. And a girl with curly hair about 6. Appeared out of nowhere were visible for a few seconds and then disappeared.
