Location: Eutaw House

Description:
It has been rumored that the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe still exists at the Eutaw house restaurant. This is a historic inn/restaurant in Central Pa with a history of hauntings. While researching ghost stories of PA for an article, my mother and I went to talk to them about this "haunting". Shortly after we left, the horse bells on the dining area door began to ring and several people reported feeling "unusually uncomfortable and watched" when they went upstairs to the restrooms.
