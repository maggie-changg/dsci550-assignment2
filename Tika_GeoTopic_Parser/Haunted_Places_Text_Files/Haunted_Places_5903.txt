Location: Fowler Lake

Description:
In the year of 2003, it was told that an old man was out fishing on his boat at about sunset one evening, and it was thought that he either had a heart attack or it was something else, but he had fallen over the side of his fishing boat. It is said that he still haunts that lake every evening at sunset.
