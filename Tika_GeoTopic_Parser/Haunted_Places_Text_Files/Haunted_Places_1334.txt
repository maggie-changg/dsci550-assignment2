Location: Tadgell Primary school (made on state school grounds)

Description:
Mirrors vibrate and fall off walls. Blood trails found in cellar bathrooms. Odd feelings come over you when you set foot in there. Feelings of being watched in class. Things like pencils move around. Stall doors slam shut and lock in all bathrooms. Pictures and other things fall off walls. Papers hung are found on the floors, looking like they had been ripped off the wall. Woods on the edge of school grounds are haunted by the ghost of a man. ::This is an ACTUAL school, still open and running, only for another year though. For first and second grade.
