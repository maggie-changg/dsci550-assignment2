Location: The Winchester house

Description:
built from 1798 and completed 1802. General James Winchester was a hero of the revolution, a Tennessee pioneer, and one of the founders of Memphis, Tennessee. Cragfont has reopened for the season. I can attest to strong energy levels in the master bedroom and the nursery, as well as a few other areas of the house. Be sure to stop by on a Sunday and ask Joanne for the "ghost tour."
