Also, it was haunted by some unknown force, and one of the inhabitants discovered the body of a 13 year old girl buried in the walls. *This is actually the President's House (where William and Mary current president's live during their term). We do not know the gender of the person entombed in the wall as only bone fragments were found and no testing was completed. Also, on a third floor window, scratched into the glass are the words, O Fatal Day, but no explanation as to why they are there or where they came from.
