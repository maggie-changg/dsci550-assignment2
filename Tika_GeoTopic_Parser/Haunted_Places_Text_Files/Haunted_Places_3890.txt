Location: Cincinnati Job Corps Center

Description:
This building at 1409 Western Avenue was constructed in the late 1800s and formerly served as a convent and later, as an armory.  It currently houses this trade school and dormitories for the students.  The hauntings take place on the second, third and fourth floors, as well as the attic.  There have been sightings of an apparition described as a nun, but more commonly, students report hearing footsteps in the hallways when no one is around.  They routinely report seeing water faucets turn themselves on and off.  Legend has it that the ghost is that of a nun who killed herself there many generations ago.
