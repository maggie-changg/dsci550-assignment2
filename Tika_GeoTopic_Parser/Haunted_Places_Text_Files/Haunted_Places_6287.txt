Location: 1915 Abandoned Mine

Description:
A Once Profitable Mine located on a Mountainside in a small community known as Ethel. Eerie presences are known to be seen near the Mine opening. Footsteps could clearly be heard echoing from deep within the cavern. A small light waving from within it's depths slowly passing back and forth.
