Location: Bailey House

Description:
Old abandon house on Bailey. Its windows are all boarded up and all the sheds, and pull barns are falling down behind the house. Teenagers go into the house to get a thrill and to just look at all the stuff that was left behind. No one really knows why the owners just up and left. It is said that there's a bell in the kitchen that is hanging from a light, and if you stand in the dark the bell will start ringing even though there is nothing inside to make it ring. You can also hear footsteps upstairs; Howls, and when you are walking away from the house you can hear a little girl laughing. - May 2008 Update: Burned down.
