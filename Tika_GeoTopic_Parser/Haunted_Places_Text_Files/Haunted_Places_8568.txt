Location: Fort Concho

Description:
Many ghosts haunt this "best preserved" frontier army fort in America. The buffalo soldiers were stationed here in the late 19th century for protection against Indian attacks. Many of them are still there along with others. Officers Quarters' #1 still has a little girl upstairs who died of an illness. She can be seen from time to time. Ask any employee for details. Conrad McClure, and employee and re-enactor have had many ghostly encounters there during his career.
