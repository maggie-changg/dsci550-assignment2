Location: Michigan Ave. near Ferry Lane

Description:
About 80 years ago, there was a rowdy dance hall along Michigan Avenue in Shrewsbury.  There is nothing left of the building; in fact, there is no indication that the dance hall ever existed.  However, residents of this coal town have reportedly heard the sounds of a dance hall (music, laughter, etc.) when walking along the avenue at night
