Location: Gravity HIll

Description:
Back in December, 1946 a school bus was hit by a Southern train killing 12 children and the driver, Richard Sanders. According to newspaper accounts the accident was horrible and even described in some detail about finding a child's body on the cow catcher of the train. Although I have never heard of anyone experiencing anything in this location, I stopped on the tracks and literally had my truck pushed across the tracks. The road that crosses the track goes uphill. I have also taken photos of the area and in the woods surrounding the track you can make out what appears to be children.
