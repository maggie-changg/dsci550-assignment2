Another story about this land is a native American woman walking down the side of the road and when you ask her for a ride she talks to you and says she's home and then she walks in the ditch and goes to the house that was torn down a few years back and she disappears in mid air. The church is located about 8 miles north of Sulphur, Oklahoma and its called Salem Church. Itâ€™s on the right side of the road by Carisel Farms. Rumors have it that you can pull in there and hear people talking and see them walking around the cemetery.
