Location: Old Van Wert church and graveyard

Description:
Very old church and graveyard. It is very eerie and foreboding. Many workers buried here from the quarries that dot the area. Slave brutality was reported here as well. Spectral entities and eyes that seem to follow you everywhere, especially in the wooded area around the cemetery have been reported. The whole Rockmart, Cedartown, Fish creek and Van Wert area haunted.
