Description:
Thompson Hall - Thompson Hall was where Gross-Anatomy was located for its med school until they built a separate building for the med school. There are rumors that it was used for the morgue at one time also. There are reports of seeing people on floors that are locked and electronically monitored when no one had opened the doors. The lights will go out and sometimes turn on when you are directly under them.
