Location: Starvation Heights

Description:
A woman named Dr. Linda Burfield Hazzard ran a sanitarium back in the early 1900's or so. Her theory was that any disease could be cured by fasting(going for weeks, sometimes months, on end without food). It is said that she intentionally starved her "patients" (I prefer to refer to them as victims)to death and buried them on the sanitarium grounds, planting a tree over each body, and when she ran out of room for bodies, she threw them off of the cliff on the back side of where the building once stood. Her reason for killing the "patients" was out of greed: she had wills written up (some of them fake)that gave her full possession of her deceased "patients'" money and valuables, causing her to gain a fortune by their deaths. All that stands of the sanitarium today is the foundation, and the incinerator in which she reportedly cremated some of the bodies. And the trees that act as sinister headstones to the many nameless innocent people who fell victim to the woman's twisted, immoral and cruel scheme.
