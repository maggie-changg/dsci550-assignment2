Location: The Town

Description:
The little town of Hamilton near Craig, in Northwestern Colorado has a benevolent spirit of a mountain man or trapper from a century ago. Sightings of him are wearing buckskins and smoking a pipe. He suddenly disappears and only the smell of the pipe remains. Witnesses will catch a glimpse out of the corner of their eye. When they turn to look there is nothing there, also the strong scent of a pipe or cigar.
