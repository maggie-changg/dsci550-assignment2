Location: Shattuck/St. Mary

Description:
There has been a number of hauntings in this old school. You can see old headmasters walking through the halls. In the boys dorm you can see a mama lab and her puppies. Shattuck/St. Mary was an old military school and you can still see in the theatre people walking around the stage. - April 2007 Correction - Shattuck was NEVER an infirmary. www.s-sm.org/arch/history/. It has been a school since 1858, never was a hospital or a ski lodge. faribault.org/History1/Limestone_fun.htm#Shattuck. Whitney Memorial Arch artistically frames Shumway Hall at Shattuck School. Shattuck was originally a grammar school as part of the Episcopal Seabury Divinity Seminary. It later offered secondary-level military education for boys, and finally merged with St. Maryâ€™s to become a private co-educational preparatory school. The arch was constructed in 1926 of limestone salvaged from two other early campus buildings.
