Location: Athens State College

Description:
During the Civil War, a mysterious lady in a flowing lace dress was looking out her window when confederates bombed the place. She was so frantic, she took one last look at her room on the very top floor, and jumped out the window. She hit an open window on the way down, splattering blood down the wall of what is now a college. Every Monday morning at exactly nine o'clock, you can see the horrific scene in a ghostly, transparent sort of way. Every other day of the week, you see her, standing there, looking out of her window.
