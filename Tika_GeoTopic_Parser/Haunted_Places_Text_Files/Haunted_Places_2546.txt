Location: Rio Hondo Hospital

Description:
This building was closed down about 5-7 years ago. Extreme hot and cold spots felt, screams heard, doors seem to open and close on their own accord, and apparitions of people. - September 2005 Update: The hospital has been torn down and houses are being built on this site.
