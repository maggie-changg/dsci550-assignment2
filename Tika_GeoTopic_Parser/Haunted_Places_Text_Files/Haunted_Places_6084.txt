Location: State Nursing Home &amp; Hospital

Description:
Yelling and screaming has been heard & seeing apparitions of different people walking around.- September 2004 Update: the old structure is falling in on its self and will be slated for demolition soon. The county has involved a no trespassing rule, since some people for Des Moines and the surrounding area decided to use it as "paint" ball battlefield two years ago. The home has several structural issues to it, including a collapsing floor. In regards to haunting and "things", yes, there's something to it. A lot of people suffered there, and the sadness of that place can be felt today.
