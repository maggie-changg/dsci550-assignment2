Description:
McAuliffe Hall -  Is indeed haunted by a small boy and woman in green is possibly true but she is believed to haunt the front staircase, and around midnight, if you are not holding the rail, she'll shove you. He said that when he first moved in, a woman used to begin singing every night at 10 PM. An insomniac, he found this annoying and finally asked the woman to stop.
