Description:
Porter College - B Building â€“ 1st Floor - On the first floor of B building three rooms are known as the "Bermuda Triangle" This hall is no longer occupied but when it was there were many reports of noises and voices heard, objects flying across the rooms and a feeling that there was something extremely malicious there. The malicious feeling persists for people just walking down the hall.
