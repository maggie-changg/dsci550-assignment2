Location: Stillman College

Description:
Hay Hall - On the second floor, there have been reports of one of the rooms being haunted by a girl who use to live there. Also, you can hear voices and loud sounds coming from the third floor of this hall. Itâ€™s strange that noises come from there, because nobody has occupied the third floor in years.
