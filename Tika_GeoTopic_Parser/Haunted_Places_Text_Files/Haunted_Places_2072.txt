Location: Old Gym

Description:
There was a little boy who was playing basketball. He threw the ball up and it broke the glass. He went up to get it and a piece of glass cut into him deeply. If you go to the attic, you can hear a boy screaming. If you listen closely, you can also hear a piano playing.
