Location: McGee's Tavern: Point Pleasant

Description:
At the bar there is a presence of a ghost that haunts the owner ever night ... once a Hotel in the 1800's as well as a former nursing home and housing for slaves - Lewis Carter (reportedly a former slave) opens the blinds in the attic every morning after the owner shuts them every night.
