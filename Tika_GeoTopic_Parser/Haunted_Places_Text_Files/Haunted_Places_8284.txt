Location: Holiday Dorsey

Description:
Fife House - Doc Holiday was an outlaw, who died of tuberculosis. No one knows why he haunts the house. But if you take a picture and get it enlarged he can usually be seen in the window of the top left room. This place is no longer a home but now a visitor site.
