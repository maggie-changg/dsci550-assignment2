Location: Pritchard Park

Description:
A man in all black will approach you. A very pale face and black eyes pierce through you. He will let out an evil growl. Then he will just fade out of sight and then you hear evil laughter. - June 2008 Investigation: While 1 of the investigators was sitting by a tree near the wooded area in the darkest portion of the park, he began asking questions with the EVP recorder and after asking many questions with no response, the question "Would you mind if we came back?" sparked a very loud growl followed by a very sinister, very dark laughter. Sounds a little far fetched, however, there was nothing visible on the Hi8 and upon listening to the EVP, the growl and laughter was audible.
