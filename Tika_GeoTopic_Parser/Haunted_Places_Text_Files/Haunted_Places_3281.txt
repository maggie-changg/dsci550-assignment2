Location: Governor’s Mansion

Description:
The Governor’s Mansion was said to be a School for girls back in the early 1930's to the late 1940's but was later shut down for reasons still unknown. However the house is located right by an old Indian cemetery, which is said to be haunted by the lost souls, in any case the house is guarded by an eight-foot fence wrapped with barbwire. Its said that strange things will happen to anyone who goes to visit the Mansion, things such as flashlights quitting after you enter the gate, softening of the ground, even the playing of an old abandoned piano which will play as soon as you step up onto the porch. Some even say the have spotted an old Indian playing the piano.
