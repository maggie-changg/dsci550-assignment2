Location: Wayside Inn

Description:
Many guests at this old motel off I-5 have felt uneasy while staying there. During the night loud noises can be heard coming from rooms that are vacant. Even on a few occasions guests have been awaken by a knock at the door yet no one is there, and the knocking persists throughout the night. A few of the rooms here back into a field which is said to be an old graveyard. Some of the rooms have bathroom windows that look out onto the field and many guests report glowing red eyes looking at them through the window. - March 2005 Update - The Wayside has been gone for many years. all that remains is the main part that was turned into a variety of restaurants. It is now vacant.
