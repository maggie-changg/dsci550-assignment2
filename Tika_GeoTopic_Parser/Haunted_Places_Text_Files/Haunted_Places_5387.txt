Description:
Keating Hall - basement - This building is not original to the campus. It was possibly built over the morgue tunnels in the 1930's. The basement was the original cafateriea, and once the new cafeteria was built it was turned in to a congressional library. They are currently renovating it to be a student center. Late 1970's: a security guard was on his break in the basement lounge of Finlay, when the doors closed themselves and the chairs started to bang themselves against the wall. he got up and the hell out of there and quit his job on the spot.
