Location: Nu'uanu

Description:
Old Pali Road - People have seen a huge ghostly white blob moving across the road in front of their vehicles as they drove on this old road to get to the Pali Lookout at night. Many accidents have happened on this road, for there are no street lights and the forestry is very thick, often blocking out the moonlight.
