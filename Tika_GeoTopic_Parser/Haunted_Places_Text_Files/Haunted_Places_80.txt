Location: Oak Hill Cemetery

Description:
On the end of a deep, wide ,circular pit is a mausoleum. It is painted green, vines have long since overgrown the name and front. Pictures taken on three different days and times (lighting) all show a "mist" in the top corner. One the shape of two figures is clearly visible. Vandals have written, "meg lives" on the ground in front and a pentagram in red on the door. A deep sense of unease is felt in this circle. This is located in the old section of the cemetery, you get a very strange feeling as you walk through it.
