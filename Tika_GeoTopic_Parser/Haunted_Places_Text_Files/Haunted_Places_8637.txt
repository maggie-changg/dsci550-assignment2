Description:
Girls Locker Room - The Arlee High School has class pictures dating as far back as the 1920's. It is said that a girl during the early years of the High School committed suicide in the shower of the girlsâ€™ locker room. Several eyewitnesses have heard screams when walking the halls at night, or the sidewalks outside. Many students have also admitted to feeling cold drafts in the water that moves from shower to shower starting from the back to the front. To this day the screams can still be heard.
