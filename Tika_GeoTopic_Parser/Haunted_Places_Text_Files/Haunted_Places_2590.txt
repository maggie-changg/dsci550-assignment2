Location: A.B. Miller High School Theater

Description:
Strange blue lights and many other occurrences. Sometimes there is banging from within the walls and tools ending up in weird places and no one knows how they got there. Many people say they have seen figures disappear and re-appear and voices in the catwalk when no one is up there. Legend says that a teenage actress went up into the catwalk trying to fix a light (for a tech buddy) and fell off the ladder and died instantly.
