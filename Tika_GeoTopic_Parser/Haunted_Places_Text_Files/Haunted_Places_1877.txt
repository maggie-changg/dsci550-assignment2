Location: Red Hill Park

Description:
The men's restroom in Red Hill Park by the Auditorium is very real. When being inside, you will see a corpse of a dead dog dripping with blood and then it will disappear. This happens between the hours of 3 am and 345 am. Also a little boy is caught scraping his knees and he slides across the bathroom floor.
