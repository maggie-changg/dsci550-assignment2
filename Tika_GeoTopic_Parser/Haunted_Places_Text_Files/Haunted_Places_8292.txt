Location: East Hall Middle School

Description:
A thirteen year old girl was killed by two boys in the boys bathroom. On the last stall to the left (in the eight grade hallway) you can hear the stall shaking. The toilet flushes sometimes without anyone moving the knob. And bloodstains appear after they have been washed several times. The administrator regrets it but the teachers report seeing it.
