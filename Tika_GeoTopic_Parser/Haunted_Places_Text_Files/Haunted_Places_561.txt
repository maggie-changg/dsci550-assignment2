Location: Pittsville

Description:
When you are camping there, you can here voices in your pillow and you can here girls and babies screaming or crying all around you and no one will be around your campsite. You can also see and hear things getting thrown and things disappear until you leave. Sometimes when you are trying to sleep you will hear or see things moving (shadows) and also sometimes hear them getting into your cars. If you definitely want stuff to happen the spirits don't like when you move the rocks around or build dam's or chop their wood. You can also see a few chimney's around 30 ft high and u can also climb them and sometimes find oar hundreds of years old.
