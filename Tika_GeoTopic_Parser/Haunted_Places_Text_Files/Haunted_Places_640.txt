Description:
spook hollow - Back in the early 1900's a man was cheating on his wife.  He was doing this in a cabin somewhere back in the woods in the hollow.  Well one day his wife found out and went back with a gun and shot both of them.  And it is still said you can hear the screams of them getting killed some nights.
