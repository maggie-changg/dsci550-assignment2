Location: Rivera high school

Description:
A girl was said to have been murdered in the shower stalls of the girls locker room. On late practices Students sometimes heard the showers go off and what looked like liquid pouring down the drain, and you could hear a blood curling scream that would make them run out in a heartbeat. And even the volleyball coach said when he was painting the raider logo on the wall he heard the scream and as if someone was being banged against the lockers.
