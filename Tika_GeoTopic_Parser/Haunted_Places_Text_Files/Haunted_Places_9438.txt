Location: Bagdad Cemetery

Description:
Witnesses have heard kids laughing in the daytime, just outside the cemetery (in the overgrowth of the property. There were no sign of kids where the noise came from. We also caught a few orbs on film when we visited there at night. Note of caution, the county sheriffs department stakes out the road nearby and patrols the cemetery because of vandals and drug users. A Local legend is associated with the large round ball tombstone in the SE corner of the cemetery, near the exit road. On dark moonlit nights, you can see and hear the granite ball slowly rotating in it's pedestal!!! Also for some reason, the three adjacent obelisks have always been refered to as "The Sentinels".
