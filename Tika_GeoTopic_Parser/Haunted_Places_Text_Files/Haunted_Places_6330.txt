Location: Shepherd College

Description:
Miller Hall -was a Civil War hospital and many civil war ghosts are seen, also a nursing student who was supposedly failing, hung herself in the attic (which is now locked), the staff says the attic was kept locked because the college was afraid that the students would hurt themselves on loose floorboards and/or damage the area, and as a fire problem since students would go up there and smoke. - March 2007 Update/Correction: Miller Hall was NEVER a Civil War hospital. This dorm was built in 1915. It was always a dormitory. Up to 1915, female students boarded with local residents and males lived at Ramsey Hall ( now under it's original name, The Entler Hotel.) The Entler was used as a Civil War hospital and is now a museum. A girl was indeed found hanged in the attic of Miller Hall in the early 1950s.
