Description:
A woman dressed in a flowing gown, somewhat like the ones from the thirties or forties, can be seen floating about a foot off the road from East to West on Lerdo Highway between Freeway 99 and State Route 43. She has been seen there for years and years. Legend has it that she was on her way to her wedding and was killed in a car accident.
