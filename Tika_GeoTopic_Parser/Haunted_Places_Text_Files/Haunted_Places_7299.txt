Location: Witch's Bridge

Description:
In the 1800's a woman was hung off the side of this bridge for being a witch. Since then, it is said that if you stop on the bridge late at night you will hear footsteps. If you stay too long, it might take a minute to restart your car. Also, strange lights flicker over the creek below.
