Description:
Edith, the ghost on the third floor of an all girl dorm. She used to be a dorm mother, but the girls were horrible to her; keeping her up all hours with pranks and what not. The woman was never completely there to begin with so she was driven to suicide, hanging herself in her room. All the girls hear her come in from time to time, she'll change channels on the television, flip lights and move furniture while you sleep.
