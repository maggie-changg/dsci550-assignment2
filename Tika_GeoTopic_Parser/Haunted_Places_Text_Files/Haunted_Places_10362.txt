Location: Gardner Lake/St. Thomas More

Description:
At St. Thomas More prepatory boarding school this is a chapel on garner lake. Many years ago people had taken pictures of the chapel in which a little girl appeared but was not really there. Recently many sightings of this girl have been seen by those who did know about the picture. She would stand in people's rooms in the Edmunds Dormitory staring at corners of the room crying and tapping on the walls. As if she was in punishment. And many of those who witnessed the girl had claimed of that in which they had a strange dream that led up to it. And then the dream supposedly was coming true all day but thought nothing of it.
