Description:
Locker Room - In the girls locker room showers have been believes to be haunted because some girls have gone down there and the showers have cut on and off completely by themselves. Lockers have slammed and the showerheads move without anyone moving them. Another thing is that there are a lot of bangs on the ceiling. While the girls where changing one day they heard walking noises when everyone was being completely still.
