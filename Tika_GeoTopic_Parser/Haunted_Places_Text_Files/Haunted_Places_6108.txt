Location: Mechanists Hall

Description:
Mechanists Hall used to be a school, but now is sometimes used for meetings and such. Sometimes at night lights inside the building flicker, but if you drive a car up it usually doesn't happen. If you go behind the building you can sometimes hear voices, but you can't make out what they are saying.
