Location: Peoria Players Theatre

Description:
"Players" is supposedly haunted by Normie the friendly ghost. He died on stage during a performance a long time ago. This is possible because Players is the third oldest theatre in the country (I think). Normie has been seen backstage several times and has even helped a few people out with lighting. The toilets have flushed themselves He supposedly likes the women's dressing room too. A painting of him hangs in the bathroom.
