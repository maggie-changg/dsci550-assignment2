Location: Rio Grand River

Description:
This lady back in the days when the river ran a mile wide. She got sick of her kids and drowned them. She shortly died after word. Only to be sentenced to her own type of hell. She is now in search of her kids, which was promised she would never find. To this day you can see her faint glow across the river with her high-pitched screechy scream that will leave your ears ringing for weeks.
