Location: Children's Forest

Description:
It is known that a neighboring resident found an antique glass jar in the woods of Children's Forest. A week later, when the jar was kept inside the resident's garage, a group of teenagers saw a depressed indian walking through a table. The next day they busted the jar against a tree inside the Forest, and now they say you can hear Indian calls from within the woods.
