Location: Oak Hill Cemetery

Description:
Reports of a lady in White & many white figments float through the air. - June 2008 Investigation: The reports of a woman in white is easily dismissed because of the very lifelike statue that is illuminated by lights all around it. It's very scary, but definitely not a ghost. Also, the white lights throughout the cemetery are markers so that people donâ€™t trip at night. Regardless, they are just lights. Also, people leave the covered candles by graves and create the same effect, only creepier, as they flicker in the wind sometimes. No paranormal activity.
