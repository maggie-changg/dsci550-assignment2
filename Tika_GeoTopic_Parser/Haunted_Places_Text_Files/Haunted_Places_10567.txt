Description:
Unimproved roads surrounding - There are two interesting haunted locations in this area.  The first is a small cemetery located about 150 yards off the main highway.  On moonlit nights, an indistinct figure can be seen leaning against a gatepost smoking a cigarette.  Another figure that can be seen is a translucent motorcyclist riding silently past late night walkers and drivers.
