Location: Old Fire station

Description:
There is a fire station on the north side of town that my brother worked at. The only night that something would happen was Halloween. Ear-shattering screams and rumbling were heard. The walls would sweat, even though there weren't any leaks or plumbing works behind the wall. Every Halloween, the entire crew would pack up and drive down the road on the fire truck and sleep on the truck.
