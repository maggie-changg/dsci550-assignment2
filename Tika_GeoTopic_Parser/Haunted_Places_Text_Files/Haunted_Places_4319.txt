Location: Higbee's Beach

Description:
At least 3 ghosts can be seen in the wildlife reserve and beach. Higbee appears whenever someone approaches his grave; he can be seen chasing the ghost of a slave down the wooded paths. A phantom sailor appears in his beige-colored "slops" atop a dune, and then disappears.
