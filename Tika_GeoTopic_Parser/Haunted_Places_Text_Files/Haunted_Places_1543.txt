Location: Happy Hollow Burial Grounds

Description:
Strange sense of heat when entering field. Just a sense that you aren't wanted there. Apparition of a man with a large hat was seen in the opening we came through. Approached the graveyard a second time and he was seen again, by the entrance just staring at us. Don't go out here unless you are looking for a paranormal experience.
