Location: Moravian College

Description:
Music Building - Once known as the single sisters house - The spirit of a revolutionary war nurse haunts these grounds. Students have felt cold spots, seen her figure, and felt as if being watched. Doors also open and close of their own accord, and footsteps have been heard when no mortal has made them.
