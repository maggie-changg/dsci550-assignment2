Location: Holiday Inn Holidome

Description:
There's a ghost of a man in the top hall of the northwest wing that is an ominous presence. The ghost of a woman looks out over the swimming pool, from one of the rooms, when children are playing, supposedly to watch over them. The main apparition though, is of a little girl who haunts a room across the hall and a bit east of the now unused king suite. She does little poltergeist activities mainly- (guests there often find their key cards missing, etcetera) and she also blasts the air conditioning.
