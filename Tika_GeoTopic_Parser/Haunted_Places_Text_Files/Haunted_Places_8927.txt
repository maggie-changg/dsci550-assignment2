Location: Millermore Mansion at Old City Park Museum

Description:
This 1860's mansion was the home of the same Dallas family for over 100 years before becoming part of the museum. Consistent stories are told of a ghostly female presence in the second floor area around the former nursery. Visitors, docents, and staff have all felt the presence over the last 25 years.
