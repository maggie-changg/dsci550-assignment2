Location: Calvary Cemetery on hwy s

Description:
odd smells and noises.  The smell of roses, rotten flesh and others.  Sightings of orbs.  Sounds of walking, something growling, talking, whispering, and babies crying.  Certain spots get windy when there is no wind.  And other spots get cold or colder than the weather is at that time.  Also seen shadows of dark figures and could not tell whether it was a man or woman or child or adult.
