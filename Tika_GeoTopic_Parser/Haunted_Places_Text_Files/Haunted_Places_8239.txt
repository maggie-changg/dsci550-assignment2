Location: Canton

Description:
Hell Church - is a place located in the old part of Canton. There is a long narrow road going back into the woods that is very difficult to get down. You then come upon a church, out in the middle of nowhere, there is a very small (one room ) and white. Located directly across the road is a cemetery with graves dating back to the 18th century. Although there have been accounts of graves freshly dug. The story goes that back in the 80's a boy was found mutilated. Most say that it was a cult killing. But the church was shut down and the newspaper clipping of this horrible event still exists. The church has been re-opened but there are still accounts of hearing faint piano music coming from inside the church late at night.
