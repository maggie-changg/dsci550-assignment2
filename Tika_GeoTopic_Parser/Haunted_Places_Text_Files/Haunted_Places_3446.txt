Location: West side Lake

Description:
Lake George - there is a paranormal force that lurks within the cabins of the camp. A true fact: "Four kids were walking along in the woods, when they came upon an abandoned cabin with high, foggy windows. Two kids lifted the smaller kid to boast up to get a better view of what was 'concealed' inside! There in the cabin beheld a game room with chairs folded up around the room, however when the other kid wanted a look for herself, she reported something much different than that! Nevertheless, the other girl saw a folded-up game table against the wall...instead of a game room she beheld a large rectangular table with all the chairs perfectly seated around the table.
