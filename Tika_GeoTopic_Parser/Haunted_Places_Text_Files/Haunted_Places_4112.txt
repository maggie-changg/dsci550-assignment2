Location: Old Mount St. Mary's Hospital

Description:
It was staffed for years by a group of nuns. One of them, beloved by all who met her, loved her roses; she grew the loveliest rose gardens about the hospital, and when she died in the fullness of her years, her room was filled with roses, gifts from a grieving community. To this day if you step into that administration office that used to be her quarters, you will catch a whiff of roses. The nuns used to march at night, every evening; all patient rooms had to have their doors shut before this ritual was performed. It is said that the nuns march again before a patient dies.
