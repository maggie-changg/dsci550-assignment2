Location: Riverside Cemetery

Description:
There is a chair made from concrete that looks like it is made of wood, that supposedly if you sit in it you will die within one year. There are rumors that some people, who died very normal deaths (like car accidents), sat in the chair a month or two before their deaths. - April 2004 Update:A visitor to our site reported the chair it is not there any more, but in fact it is there as of November 28th of 2004. It is in the older part of the cemetery. If you look for it you can find it.
