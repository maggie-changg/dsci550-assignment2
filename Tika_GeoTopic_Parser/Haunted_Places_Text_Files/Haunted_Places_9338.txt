Location: Metal Museum/Army hospital

Description:
The Metal museum of Memphis is on part of the grounds of what was the army hospital. This was ground zero for the yellow fever epidemic - and the equivalent of the CDC. Thousands died here. There are many tails of things at night. There is a lot of activity in the morgue building and the doctorâ€™s residence.
