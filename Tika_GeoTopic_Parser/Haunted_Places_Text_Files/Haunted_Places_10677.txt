Location: Kiawah Island

Description:
A 19th century plantation existed on this island and during a stay in 2002 in one of the homes on the island, one witness got the distinct impression that the spirit of a small boy,(who might have died while wandering away into the interior of the island looking for his cat) was seen (along with the ghost of a cat) running though the house and through walls. Some further research might be warranted to determine if any deaths are associated with the plantation on this island.
