Description:
In the lower level of the hospital, the mental ward, you can see figures walking, hear moaning, and chains rattling, and some even say you can feel the pain of all the dead when you are in the rooms. It is said that the doctors buried the patients in the dirt floor, and kept using the rooms, and when you enter the rooms, you can feel people breathing on your neck
