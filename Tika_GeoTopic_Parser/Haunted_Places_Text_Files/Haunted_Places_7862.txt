Description:
Pali Drive's Morgan's Corner - At that area in Morgan's corner, there is a trail near Morgan's corner that looks like a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel there was 3 ghosts walking around there. 2 men and 1 woman. The person doesn't know what happen but at the end of the tunnel somewhere on the wall shows a metal door. And there are also tire marks on the trail. The tunnel is really dark and you need a flashlight in order to see, it is also a long tunnel.
