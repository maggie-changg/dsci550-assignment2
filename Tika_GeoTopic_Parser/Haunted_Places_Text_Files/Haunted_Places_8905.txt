Location: Downtown

Description:
The Smith Building - The building has been under construction for some time now and some of the workers were complaining that they would hear things move and fall. At times the doors would close by themselves. One worker has said to seen a little girl in a white dress. Nobody seemed to have believed them so one man took a home video camera and went throughout the rooms on the second fall and you can see the doors close after he had passed by and three times you can see the little girl standing in the corner. Of course ha ran but went back and saw her again but this time she looked liked she was going towards him so he took of running again and you could see stuff being thrown at him. The video is real its something that if you see you will believe.
