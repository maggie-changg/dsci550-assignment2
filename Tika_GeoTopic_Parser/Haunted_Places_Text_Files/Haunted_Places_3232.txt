Location: Tucker Cemetery

Description:
Legend has it that old man Tucker went insane one day in the late 1800's, and killed his children, his wife, and his mother and buried them in his cellar underneath his house. He took his awn life a short time later. The property was converted into a cemetery and the foundation, and cellar to the house are still standing. Strange red lights and figures of people are seen wandering late at night. The cellar is full of pentagrams and Satanic chills. Devil worshiping takes place frequently here. - August, 2004 Correction, Formerly posted under Duncan, Tucker Cemetery is Five Miles outside of Comanche Oklahoma, on Tucker Road. Duncan is close,but its closer to Comanche.
