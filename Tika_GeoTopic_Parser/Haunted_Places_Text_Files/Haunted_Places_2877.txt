Location: "The Domes"

Description:
At night, you can hear footsteps and eerie whispering in the very back dome. You see a shadowy figure run from dome to dome, and you can sometimes see it walking in the surrounding desert. There have been reports of tapping noises on cars when you're parked there. There is always a very weird vibration there and you always seem to feel uneasy, like something bad is going to happen. It is said that the domes were used in black magic, and that many people have been raped and killed there.
