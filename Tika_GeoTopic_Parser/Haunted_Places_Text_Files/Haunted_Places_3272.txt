Description:
There is a little girl there. Two maintenance workers who never knew each other, and never worked together both said they saw a little girl go into the MEN's restroom .They went to investigate and on both accounts there was no one there. This was at 5 am when the store was not open and just the crew was there. A crew member was mopping lobby when the MEN's bathroom door came open and stayed open, he went to investigate and no one was there. At that same moment all the toilets in the WOMAN's restroom flushed by themselves.2 managers who had been working there 10+ years shared a similar experience on different nights. On both occasions they were counting money when the office got extremely cold then the computer mysteriously came on by itself. One crew person quit because of her experienceâ€™s was cleaning the WOMAN's restroom when she heard a little girl laugh and there was no one there.(it was after the store had closed)There has been many occasions of people feeling like they are being touched or they have ice cold sensations while they are there. There have been many instance of the door in the WOMAN's restroom being checked at close and being open or being just shut but when the opening crew came in it was LOCKED. Many people have heard the little girl and some have saw her but no one knows where she came from or what she is doing there.
