Location: Beechfork Elementary School-  This Old school was closed down last year, Because it became in such bad need of repairs, It was no big thing at first, All the equipment was removed, And the students were moved to a new school some 15 miles away, But after a while lights begin to be seen late at night, While there is no power at all in the old school, And if you stop on the Highway that runs close by it, You can still here the voices of students, And teachers, And some times late at night especial if its raining, A lone figure of a man can be seen walking the school grounds, They say it is the ghost of the man that donated the land for the school, They say that he is very unhappy that his school has been closed down, And that all of the children are gone, And if you don't move on soon, He will begin to walk toward you car, With a wicked look on his face, He wants to make sure that nothing happens to his school, After all he loved kids, hats why he gave the land for a school in the first place, Harrodsbu

Description:
shaker village - the previous entry about the village at Pleasant Hill was entirely wrong.  The Shaker village is reportedly haunted, by many various spirits; however the idea that the Shakers drown babies is hideously wrong.  The shakers loved and cherished all the children in their community.  There are many stories of hauntings and I encourage everyone to visit this special place and find out the story of the shakers who lived there and may very well be there still.
