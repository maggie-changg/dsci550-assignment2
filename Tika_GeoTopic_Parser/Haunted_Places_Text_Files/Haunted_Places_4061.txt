Location: Lucas Cemetery

Description:
It is haunted by Mary Jane. Everyone calls her "Bloody Mary". She was burnt at the stake in the 1800's because she was claimed a witch. The tree she was buried under still stands with her name carved in it. If you go there on the night she was buried then the tree will bleed. If you go back where her house once stood you will notice a sudden drop in temperature about 20 Degrees). I highly advise you not to say her name in the mirror five times if you ever visit the town of Mansfield. - June 2008 Correction - No Trespassing - No one calls her Bloody Mary, just Mary Jane. The story is published in "Haunted Ohio". She was not burned at the stake; she lived to a ripe old age. She was a Native American medicine woman and as time went on younger generations saw her as a witch and as such she was harassed. But there are a lot of similarities between the two. She lived on land that a young farmer took care of and he looked out for her, as she was his fatherâ€™s friend. She died at an old age and did put a "curse," of sorts, on the farmland and the land around. There is a marker where she is supposedly buried but she is not there. There are several hills that surround the property and she is buried on one of those, no one knows which, because she wanted to always be able to see the sun set. The farmer would always chase kids off trying to ghost hunt and even shoot at them.
