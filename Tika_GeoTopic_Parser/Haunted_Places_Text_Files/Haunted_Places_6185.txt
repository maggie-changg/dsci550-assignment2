Location: Greenwood Cemetery

Description:
The Blue Angel - is a statue in the Greenwood Cemetery who used to hold a rose and if the person looking at the angel, if she dropped the rose, you were doomed to death. Eventually some people cut off her hand so that she wouldn't be able to hurt anyone anymore, but at night time her hand was still there, glowing in the night holding the rose that she might drop on you. When approaching the angel you will see the sky turn blood red and when you look at the trees cause the angel is set back all by itself in a cove, the short side of the trees will be swaying and the tall side will not. - March 2007 Background Information: The Blue Angel is made of an ebony white gypsum. In the sides of the mausoleum in which she is housed are two cobalt blue stained glass windows. One to the east and one to the west. Each morning as the new dawn emerges and each night as the day ends the sun shines thru the windows bathing her in a luminescent glow turning her white figure blue. During the 50's stories of the blue angel were all of a benevolent nature. She was the protector, the guardian angel of the cemetery, protecting all within from any vandals or wrong doers. It is very sad the current stories of any evil associated with her.
