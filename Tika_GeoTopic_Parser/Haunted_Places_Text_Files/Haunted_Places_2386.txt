Location: Castle Air Museum

Description:
Formerly part of Castle Air Force Base, it houses one of the nation's largest collections of aircraft. One particular craft, an old B-29, is said to be haunted by a former crewmember who died when a bomb exploded in the aircraft while on a mission. He's said to turn the landing lights on and off and is known to make the propellers turn, though they are locked into place. Don't worry, he's friendly.
