Location: The Cross

Description:
This is an old one room cabin that sits at the bottom of a large hill.  Cabin has been secured with an old fashioned cot, old wooden table and chair, and a large bible on the table.  At the top of the hill, an extremely old, 15 to 20ft cross.  Its has been reported that if you look into the cabin the bible will be closed, and if you go to the top of the hill and touch the cross, go back and the bible will be open.  This happens regardless of the fact that it is completely secured.    Finding this location is extremely difficult, a maze of gravel and dirt roads.  Is said to have been a cemetery site at one time, and then owned by a cult in the '60s and 70s where many animals were found sacrificed.
