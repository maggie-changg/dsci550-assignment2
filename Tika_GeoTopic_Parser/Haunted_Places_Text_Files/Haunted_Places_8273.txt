Location: Old Douglas Hospital

Description:
Which is now the education building. Many people have seen an old typewriter being typed on at night. At night, the last people to leave will open all the doors down the hallway and as they begin to leave they will look back and all the doors will be closed. A nurse and her tray have often been heard going down the hall. You should definitely come and examine this place.
