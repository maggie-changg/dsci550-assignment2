Location: Nasa Road 1

Description:
this part of Nasa Road 1 was completely within the last couple of years, and runs through two sets of neighborhoods. On the new road, witnesses have seen several shadow forms crouching at the edge of the trees, seen more shadows crossing the road and felt presences watching me. At the end of Nasa Road 1, there is a neighborhood that has been there for several years. Within that neighborhood, first is a large tree that radiates a dark presence. There is house next to it that is almost constantly lit, but that tree remains dark. A cemetery near by is reported to have demonic looking creatures roaming it.
