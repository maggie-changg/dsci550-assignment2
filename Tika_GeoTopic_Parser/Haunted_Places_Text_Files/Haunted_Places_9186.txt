Location: Witches Grave

Description:
Supposedly in the 17-1800s, a black slave was accused of being a witch. She was hung in a nearby tree (which is still there) and buried in the cemetery. Her grave marker says something like "whoever passes over this grave, shall die as I died"... the words are so worn off that you can hardly read them. On Halloween night, people claim to hear the "witch" and sometimes see her hanging in the tree.
