Location: Naturally You Wig &amp; Hair Salon

Description:
Smells of some one baking, even though there is no stove. Knocking on walls, lights flickering, faces seen looking out of window at night. Personal items being moved from one place to another. "People" walking down hallway when there was no one there. Bells ringing at the front door. Haunted possibly by an old man and woman, or maybe even farm help.
