Description:
the ghosts of some of the 100's of people she and her gang murdered. She ran the reverse underground R.R. - September 2005 Update/Correction: the "Patty Cannon House" is not really the Patty Cannon House---the history behind the Patty Cannon house was exposed on the PBS show "History Detectives". The historic marker is wrong. The real Patty Cannon house is no longer standing.
