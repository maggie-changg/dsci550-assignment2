Location: Maryville Academy

Description:
Back in the 1930's when the Academy was used as a Catholic orphanage, there was evidence that the girls' dormitory was haunted by the spirit of a nun. There were sounds of footsteps, swishing of skirts, and the sound of the rosary beads clicking, but the nun herself was invisible.
