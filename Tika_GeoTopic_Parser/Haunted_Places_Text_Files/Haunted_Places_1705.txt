Location: Coronado Apartments

Description:
An apartment on the first floor of the M building is haunted by the spirit of a woman. Muffled voices are heard, phantom music emanating from the kitchen, lights turned on and off, cabinet doors opened, and she has appeared as a full apparition. Apparently there was a death in the apartment that could contribute to this, but the woman's apparel seems to be from a time predating the apartment complex's construction.
