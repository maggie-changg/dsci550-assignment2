Location: Candlewood Suites Hotel

Description:
Lights turn on and off by themselves. Cool breezes can be felt in the hallways when there are no windows or doors open. People have reported seeing a shadowy figure out of the corner of their eye but when they turn to look nothing is there. One employee reports feeling what seemed like icy cold fingers brush against the back of her neck but when she turned around no one was there. Supposedly when they were clearing the woods to build the hotel the body of a woman who committed suicide was found. She had shot herself in the head. They say she now haunts the building and grounds.
