Description:
Room #9 -  built in the 1700's is supposedly haunted by Jeshua.  Jeshua waited her whole life waiting for her love to return from England. He never did.  She seems to respond to men who stay in the room around 3:00 AM. But only if you're very quiet.  Also room #9 is home to one of the secret drawer society.
