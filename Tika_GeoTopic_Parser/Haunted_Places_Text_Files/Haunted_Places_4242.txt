Location: Hell House

Description:
Supposedly, there was a man who was building a house for his wife and children, while it was being built the wife and children died in a horrible accident, (a train hit them) and though grief stricken, the husband completed the house. the husband was so distraught, that he set fire to the house then hung himself from the giant oak in front of the house. (it is said that sometimes there is a noose still hanging there)Though the entire house was set ablaze, only the back wall fell completely burnt, the rest of the house is intact, and many strange occurrences are said to happen there. the mystery of this haunting is that, no one is allowed to approach it at all. If you are seen going anywhere near it, you will be arrested. the old tree is still there, off of Clark road, dead, but still standing with the limb he hung himself on jutting out into the road. Be careful if you dare to go here. - January 2007 Update: Has been torn down
