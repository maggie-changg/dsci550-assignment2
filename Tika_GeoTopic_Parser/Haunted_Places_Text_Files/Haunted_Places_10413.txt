Description:
Buckel Factory - formerly submitted as "Old Belt Factory" - Inside the building here are many ghosts. They are seen sometimes in the windows and walking around out back. If you go in, you better be careful, you might not come out. Also, you can sometimes here people talking out back, and the grass moving in certain spots when no wind is blowing. Sudden cold spots can occur too. Orbs can be seen all around and inside. This place is also known as 'Hell House'. - Septmeber 2005 uupdate: A resident of West Haven has come forward to say that this is nothing more than an urban legend.
