Location: The Black Hills

Description:
A house Norwich St hosts a ghost. On the second story and in the far room at the right-hand side there is a ghost of a man that sometimes appears to be dressed in clothing from the 30's or 40's. Sometimes he appears to be an elderly man. At approximately 10:00 to 11:30 the specter wanders from the hallway and then hesitates at the doorway and then look like it is about to turn around. But then he walks into the room. The former residence to that place reported that the ghost walked to the middle of his room and stood there for minutes and then goes out into the hallway and stands. It is not known when he vanishes. He was last seen in 1996.
