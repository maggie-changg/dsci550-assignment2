Location: The Glenn Tavern Inn

Description:
There is a young boy who died there and is seen playing on the second floor and in the lobby. Also, the piano that is in the lobby plays by itself. There have been sightings of a person or apparition looking out of the window of Room 23. The rooms 305, 103, and 23 are all roamed by ghosts. On the second floor a child who died runs around after 1:00am at night. Also the ghost in 305 will walk through all the third floor doors and the lobby. The 103 ghosts just knocks little things down and looks in the window at you or whoever is staying there. It is said that the guy in 103 was shot in an illegal poker/gambling game and is looking for the money that he rightfully deserves.
