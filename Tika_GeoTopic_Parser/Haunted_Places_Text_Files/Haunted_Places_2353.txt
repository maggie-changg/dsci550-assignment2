Location: The High School auditorium (Olmshied Auditorium)

Description:
Reports of a girl died here and it's uncertain but some say that she actually died when the Forest Grove High School burned down. Reports of hearing a piano playing when there isn’t any pianos around, she messes with the lights, she messes with the sound, and one time she pulled out a stage light gel holder and dropped it rightby someone’s head.
