Location: Choctawhatchee Bridge

Description:
At a hanging gone wrong, a hole was scratched out beneath the feet of the victim who was too tall for the rope that was used. A witness to the hanging dug the hole with a crutch, under the dangling victim. To this day, you can fill the hole and the ghost will come and dig it out.
