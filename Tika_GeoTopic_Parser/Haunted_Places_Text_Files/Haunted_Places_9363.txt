Location: Two Rivers Mansion&amp; Golf Course

Description:
people walking in the mansion and items disappearing. Lights turning off and on. Witnesses report fellings like you are being watched, and if its really quiet you can hear foot steps following you around. It is known to be a litter of civil war bodies under the ground. Also known for a Indian burial ground. In the process of building the golf course there were Indian and civil war artifacts found underground. Rumor is that there was an old house that was at the very back of the golf course that was torn down along time ago that there was an old man that lived in it that buried his money under ground and if you go up there late at night you can hear him opening his jars of money that were found during the destruction of the house.
