Location: Werewolf Hollow

Description:
If you drive down the lane at Werewolf Hollow, there is a stop sign. Look close and you will see blood flowing on it. As you go on, there are cornfields. You can see a male ghost. Be careful not to stop your car because he will scratch your car. He is trying to warn you not to go on. There are some abandoned houses and if you get out of your car (if you dare) and go up to the houses, you can see a ghost in one window. In another window, you hear noises and a hole in it.
