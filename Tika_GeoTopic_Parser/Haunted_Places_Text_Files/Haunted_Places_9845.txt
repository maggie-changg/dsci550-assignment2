In the men’s restroom (the first one on the left) of on the third floor you can hear the sound of a girl laughing.  Also at around three in the morning in the showers there is a three foot tall apparition with ping pong sized eyes that look like an animals when you shine a light in them it wears a black robe with hood.  It ducks and weaves then breaks off into a sprint after you.
