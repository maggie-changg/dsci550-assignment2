Location: Riverpark Square

Description:
In 2003 a man jumped off the top escalator to fall to his death on top the painted map of Inland Washington Lakes. Now when you ride the escalator here a man whispering into your ear but you canâ€™t make out what he says. If you stare at the painted map long enough you can see visions of blood and skull pieces.
