Description:
Weird apparitions of light and ghostly figures have been reported in the basement of the Elementary School.  Most of the sightings have occurred around the old and abandoned bomb shelter (which hasn't been used since the late 70's). Several reports of weird noises coming from rooms that are empty in other parts of the school.
