Description:
A woman by the name of Aunt Jeannie Johnson lived way out there in the forest. She used a skull to do her dishes in and she would hang trespassers on an old oak tree outside her house. Her house is partly fallen in but the rope is still hanging from the oak tree. She is buried in a family graveyard close to the home. It is said that strange things happen around her house at night, especially on full moon nights and stormy nights.
