Location: The Barbee Hotel

Description:
The Barbee Hotel was considered a very high-class resort during Al Capone's time. He stayed in the hotel frequently, often clearing out all the guests so he could stay in seclusion. He always stayed in room 301 at the back of the hotel. When cleaning the rooms employees have smelled cigar smoke and when investigated it is coming from room 301. The bartender who has worked there for years has seen an old man sitting at one of the booths on several occasions. When she goes to get someone, he is gone. People have reported hearing footsteps on the stairs, and in the halls above the dining area. Many parties when taking their picture will line up on the stairs. There are several pictures on the wall where you can see orbs of light in the background behind the group. Many other celebrities stayed there as well. Rita Hayworth was said to go and stay in her room for days at a time. When you drive by the area of the hotel she stayed in late at night sometimes you can see a faint light.
