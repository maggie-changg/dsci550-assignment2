Location: Metropolitan Ave.

Description:
There's a bridge right over Metropolitan Ave by University St. It's said that a young lady in a white dress stands under the bridge looking for a ride home. When one picks the woman up and takes her home, she gets out the car and says Thanks for the ride. Then she vanishes in thin air. Most people that pick this young lady up usually goes to the door of the young women house to make sure she made it in or where she went to. But when the door opens, it is the woman's mother and she tells the people that every year someone comes to the house to drop off her daughter. The girl is her daughter who had been killed in a horrible car accident 10 years ago under a bridge on Metropolitan St. formerly known as Stewart Avenue.
