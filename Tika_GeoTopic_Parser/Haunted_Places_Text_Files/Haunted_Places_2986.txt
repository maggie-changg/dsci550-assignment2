Description:
A female figure appears repeatedly in a classroom at dawn only. Various adults have reported feeling someone touching them on their shoulder. Doors that were checked to make sure they were locked, have opened and closed on their own. A student reported hearing weird and eerie music. In the most recent account, students saw a water faucet turn on slowly, then at full blast. Next, they saw the actual water faucet handle turn itself off.
