Description:
Sorority house - Sisters who live in the sorority house have had plates thrown at them in the kitchen and break when they hit the wall. Closet doors in the attic fly open and slam shut when there is no one up there. From the first floor, you can hear people walking around and moving furniture upstairs when no one else is home.
