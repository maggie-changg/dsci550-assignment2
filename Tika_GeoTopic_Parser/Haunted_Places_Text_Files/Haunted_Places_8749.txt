Location: Screaming Sheila Bridge

Description:
Bordering an old ghost town, about 5 miles from church, there is a bridge. The town of Clara was established in the 1800's. Sometime in the mid 1800's there was a woman put to trial and convicted of practicing Wicca. She was burned alive on a bridge. The whole bridge is burnt but in one particular spot, there is a perfect circle burned all the way through. She can still be heard screaming at night. -  Febuary 2005 Update: This place is reported to no longer exist.
