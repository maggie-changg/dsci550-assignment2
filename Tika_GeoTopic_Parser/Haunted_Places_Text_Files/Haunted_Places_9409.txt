Location: Burntmill bridge

Description:
People have recorded sightings of a young girl walking back and forth across the old ran down bridge(thats only about 25 feet high), looking for her father that killed her and threw her over the bridge in the early 1960's. No one ever reported her doing harm except one had said to seen her fall off the bridge and and not make a splash when entering the water.
