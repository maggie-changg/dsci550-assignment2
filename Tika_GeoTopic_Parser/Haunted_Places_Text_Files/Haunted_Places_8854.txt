Location: University of Texas

Description:
Was known as Ft. Brown during and after the Civil War. It was occupied by both Union and Confederate troops. Soldiers, horses, cavalry officers, etc haunt it. The buildings that house the University are historical monuments. Sightings and sounds have been experienced in almost every building on campus. - December 2004 â€“ additional information - The last battles of the Mexican American war occurred in Brownsville. One of the battles was the siege on Ft. Texas (later named Ft. Brown, in honor of Maj. Jacob Brown who died in the siege) It started May 3rd and ended May 9th, 1846. There were only 2 Americans killed and 7 wounded, so the hauntings (or occurrences) are likely related to residual hauntings. (Or from the Mexican army that was slaughtered both at the fort and at the other two battle sites).
