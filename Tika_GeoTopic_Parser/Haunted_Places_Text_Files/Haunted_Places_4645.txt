Location: Old Battery Park Hotel

Description:
It's said that in a private apartment building in downtown Asheville which used to be known as the Battery Park Hotel in the early to mid 1900's, apparitions can be seen very early in the morning. Individuals who worked the morning shift in the pantry refused to go in alone because a man who was murdered there was known to reveal himself in spirit form to employees.
