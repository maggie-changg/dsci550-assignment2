Description:
"The Brown Lady" as she is most commonly called haunts the third floor of the Columns Building. Security guards have told stories of hearing footsteps and doors slamming while trying to lock up the building at night. One security guard claim to have chased the ghost to no avail, thinking it to be a prankster student.
