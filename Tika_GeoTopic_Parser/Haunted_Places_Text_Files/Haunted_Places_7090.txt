Location: Public Library

Description:
The library is haunted by the spirit of a young man who used to live there when it was a private home. He was crippled and was wheelchair bound so they had an elevator put in so he could get from floor to floor. He still rides the elevator and likes to make his presents known. Particularly to young women, by rubbing and patting. If you should ride this elevator be sure and say hello Charlie! Not his real name but a nickname someone who loved him gave him.
