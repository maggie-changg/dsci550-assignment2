Location: Cathedral High School

Description:
The Cold spots near the senior patio. In the Yearbook/Newspaper room, the staff has heard noises on floor above them, even though they were the only ones on campus. The yearbook newspaper room used to be a chapel (still has the stained glass windows), said to have a negative energy in the room. School was built over a graveyard. Coffin nails are still being found in the football field. When it rains, there is a spot on the field that never gets wet. Strange occurrences during theatre productions held in the gym have also been reported, including a chair flying across the floor.
