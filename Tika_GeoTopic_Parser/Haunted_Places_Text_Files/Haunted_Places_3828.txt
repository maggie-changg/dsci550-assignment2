It was once part of the Ohio Turnpike built in 1831, until the state rebuilt the road into a straight four-lane road in 1969. In October of that year, five teens were killed when their 1968 Impala was hit by a 1969 Roadrunner going more than 100 miles per hour. Only one guy survived. Since that day, the intersection has been haunted by a faceless hitchhiker, who the survivor has personally seen at least five times. The ghost is described as a shadowy figure in three dimensions. Psychics with no knowledge of the site have described it as very evil. A driverless Impala and a ghostly green Roadrunner have been seen in the area as well.
