Location: T. B. Sanitorium

Description:
Located on Alamo Hill just off of Douglas Ave. It is said that there was a TB scare there. It is heavily patrolled by police now but when you could get in you could see unfinished card games and tools left on tables and shelves. Screams can be heard from the patients that were being experimented on.
