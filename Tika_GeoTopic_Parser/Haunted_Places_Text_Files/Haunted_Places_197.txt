Location: Pere Cheney Cemetery

Description:
Not far from Grayling is a cemetery from the late 1800's named after a small town that died out circa 1900. The cemetery has only a handful of tombstones, many of which have been vandalized or withered with age. There is reference to several mass graves there from a plague of small pox and a major fire that destroyed the town. The cemetery has produced several tales of problems with electrical devices such as cars and radios, as well as sightings of ghostly figures and childish laughter.
