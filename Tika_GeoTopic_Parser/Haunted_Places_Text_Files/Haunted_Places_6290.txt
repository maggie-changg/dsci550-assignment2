Location: Point Pleasant

Description:
Boys Industrial School at Lakin -  It is a an old rather large house. It has 3 floors, you can feel something as soon as you enter. It has many cold spots. The feeling of not being alone. A heavy smell of smoke & death as you enter the second floor & noises as if someone is following you up and down the stairs. At times you can see a patch of a bluish fog around the place. You can hear footsteps on the second and third floors. Doors slamming with no explanation and even being touch by something. You always have the feeling of something is watching you.
