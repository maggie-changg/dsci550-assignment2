Location: Skene Manor

Description:
The apparition of a woman in a full-skirted dress and wearing a distinct ring on her right hand, haunts this old mansion. She appears for a few seconds and then turns into a glowing ball of light. There are also reports of people seeing the image of a skeleton. The mysterious lady has appeared in the dining area in various forms. Sometimes, just her hand will appear wearing a huge ring. She then materializes in the fountain behind the bar. The woman is believed to be Colonel Skene's wife. When she died, the colonel placed her body in a led lined coffin, which he kept in part of the house. After the old mansion became a restaurant, the owner placed the coffin behind the bar and built a fountain around it.
