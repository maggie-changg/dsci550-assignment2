Location: Cry Baby Bridge

Description:
The bridge is said to be haunted by a baby that was born deformed and his teenage mother threw him off the bridge because of his condition. He is said to have monstrously strong legs and he knocks over trees with them when he throws fits crying for his mother. There are trees fallen over all around the bridge. People go there to party and get more than what they were looking for. Car doors lock and windows roll down by themselves and the car begins to roll backwards. Once you are there, the baby doesn’t want you to leave, thinking you’re its long lost mother and it doesn’t want to lose you again.
