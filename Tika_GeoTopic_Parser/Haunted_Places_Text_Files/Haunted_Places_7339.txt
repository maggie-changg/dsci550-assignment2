Location: Dead Man's Curve

Description:
A few miles east of Monmouth, Illinois, on the original Highway 34, there is a curve that has been the sight of a few car accidents. A midpoint of the curve, there is a tree that a few cars have been wrapped around. The tree is supposed to move without the help of the wind, almost as if it is trying to cause another accident.
