Location: Calvary Cemetery

Description:
There is a legend of an angel statue the sits on top of a grave near the park side entrance of the cemetery. Supposedly, she turns around and weeps when it is late, or on a certain date, or something like that. Also, there are several large, old trees in the cemetery that move and sway, even if there is no wind.
