Location: Troy Country Club

Description:
When driving by the Troy Country Club at night there have been sightings of a waitress that worked there in the 70's. It is rumored that when she was driving to work there one winter night, her car slipped on ice and fell off the bridge. Even in the daytime you can see footprints leading into the woods in the snow.
