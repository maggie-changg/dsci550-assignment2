Location: Palmer Cemetery

Description:
A witness visiting a grave of a relative reports bring flowers to the grave. Upon feeling a strange feeling turned around to see if there was someone there, only to find no one. Turning back around to the grave, the flowers had vanished. Also, in this cemetery a teenage boy hung his self by the entrance and sometimes at night one of the streetlights come on and you can see him hanging from the branch that was cut down. When you walk past the cemetery you can see shadows running around and tons of orbs flying around. At times you can see a big white person holding a baby and staring out of the fence.
