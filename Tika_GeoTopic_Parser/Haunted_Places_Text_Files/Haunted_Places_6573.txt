Location: The Oxford Saloon

Description:
"This old saloon contains around 18 ghosts upstairs and down. Workers have in the past had quite frightening experiences with spirits of the old saloon girls who operated a brothel upstairs. A police officer that was stabbed and killed their remains, and a young teenager who was killed in the street by a car as well. There are too many to list, but ask someone behind the bar, and they will provide you with a detailed list compiled by psychics.
