It is located off of Salem Church Road which is off of Kelly Bridge Road. It is said by many that the Salem church is haunted. It has been around since the 1800's. Some have experienced their cars shutting off, or their lights flickering. If you look in the church, you can see a pair of glowing red eyes at the alter. If you look through the windows you can see a body standing, looking outside. - March 2004 Warning: there is NO TRESPASSING.
