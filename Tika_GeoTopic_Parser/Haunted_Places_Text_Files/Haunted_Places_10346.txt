Location: Eugene O'Neill's childhood home

Description:
The great American play write based his classic "Long Days Journey into Night", after this childhood home in which he shared with his family. His mother, who reportedly suffered severe depression, would sneak into a small room next to Eugene O’Neill’s room, and he would hear her crying and then giggling to herself throughout the night. She supposedly would inhale methane there. There have been many reports, especially by the people who work there,(it is a museum now)of footsteps in the small room, the feeling of being followed, cold spots, and most eerie, the sounds of sobbing and giggling. You can take the tour and see the room for yourself, very creepy.
