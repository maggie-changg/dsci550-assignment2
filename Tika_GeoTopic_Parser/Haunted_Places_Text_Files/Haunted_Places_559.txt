Location: John Bonnett Tavern

Description:
The first floor was originally a French outpost in the 1740's.By 1758,General Forbes had used it as an impromptu HQ during his expedition to take Ft. Duquesne. It was there that he supposedly had a French spy hanged. During the early 1760's it became a tavern with a second story added. This was then used as a frontier courtroom where several people were hanged. These restless spirits are responsible for a multitude of supernatural activities at the inn.
