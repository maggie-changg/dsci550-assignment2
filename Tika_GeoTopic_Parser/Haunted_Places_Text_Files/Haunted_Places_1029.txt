Location: Paper Mill

Description:
there once was a house across from the papaer mill and a pastor lived there. the pastor was a devil worshiper (my grandmother broke into the house from a suspision and went upstairs and there was vails full of potions with a witchcraft book) some times in the middle of the summer (it could be 98 degreese outside and up in the attic where the vails and witchcraft book was) there was ice cycles hanging off the cieling. the pastor was also a foster parent and and one day out of no where the one girl he was taking care of went missing (later on after the pastor died somebody found a females hip bone in the back yard) next door to the house a bitbole will appear in the garden (ever since then nothing will grow in the garden) then it will mysteriously dissaper. a missionnary came to the town of roaring spring back in the 1960's and as he was entering the town he said he could go no farther cause the town was feeled with evil spirits (and before you know it he was outta there and never came back) till this day there have been mysterious hauntings that no one an explain.
