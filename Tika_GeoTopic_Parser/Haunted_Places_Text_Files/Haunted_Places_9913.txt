Location: Wentworth Military Academy

Description:
There are massive amounts of stories of hauntings there. the Bell Tower, that was said to be haunted was closed down due to reconstruction, so it was closed at the time the submitter was there. There have been reports of a little boy who would come out late at night and salute the helicopter on the grounds then disappear. Also, in the scholastic building, the dark room on the lower level is boarded up because a little boy hung himself trying to escape being beaten and hazed, as they did back then.
