Location: Hickory Grove Subdivision

Description:
Sound of light footsteps, assuming a child, running down the hall. The sound of doors slamming loud enough to wake a sleeping adult and strong enough to feel a vibration on a wall has been reported. The sounds of chairs moving in the kitchen and the icemaker being used have been heard. Furniture moving in the basement office, sounded like banging of a metal file cabinet. A live two-year old running out of his room saying "Mommy, scaredy me!" when his mother goes to his room with him he says " Scaredy go way."
