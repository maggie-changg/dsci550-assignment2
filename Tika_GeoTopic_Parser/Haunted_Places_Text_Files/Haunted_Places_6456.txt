Description:
Curlew/Cascade Job corps. - a former student of Curlew Job corps has heard many of the same stories; how ever, they are set there on the Curlew campus. The tunnel story for the Curlew campus is very likely true, for that campus was a S.A.C. radar compound before the corps took it over. The Dish is still up on top of the hill lovingly referred to as "Radar hill". Cascade however, has always been a Job corps campus. Curlew is definitely haunted. Colville Native American Elders believe that the site where the Curlew campus is in the heart of sacred land. Normally sacred land reacts badly to being tampered with, but the Job corps is a place where children go to heal troubled hearts, pasts, and souls. This campus has a 98% success rate because the spirits there are helping where the staff cannot. - July 2005 Update/ Correction - Cascade Job Corps is housed in what was originally Northern State Hospital for the Insane. The Hospital opened for business in 1912 and remained an insane asylum until I believe right around 1970. Locally it is referred to simply as Northern State Mental Hospital. Hopefully we will get permission to post the experience in our Ghost Experiences Page In the dorms there are reports of feeling suffocated and seeing shadows. There have been local rumors that people where buried up there. Recently the County has admitted to this fact.
