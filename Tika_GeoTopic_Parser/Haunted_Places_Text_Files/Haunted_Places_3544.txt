Its a fantastic Bed and Breakfast in the Garden District or New Orleans. It has a couple ghosts; a black man who burned in the wood shed that "smokes," and a little girl who just wants to play. It is a fantastic Bed and Breakfast, and you can request the most haunted of the rooms. (Mostly on the 3rd. floor).
