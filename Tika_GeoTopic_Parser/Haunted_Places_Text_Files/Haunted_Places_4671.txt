Description:
There is a picture of a young Irish woman that hangs in the 5th house on the left. If you look at the picture the eyes will glow non-stop! If you look at the picture at night and walk across the room at the same time you will see the eyes follow you across the room. This lady had 5 kids, the picture has been passed down through the generations.
