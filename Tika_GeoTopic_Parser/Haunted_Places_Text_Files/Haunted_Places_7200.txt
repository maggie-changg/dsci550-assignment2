Location: Ferrell House

Description:
There used to be and old deserted house and barn, there were occasions of flaming faces, a woman hanging from a rafter in the barn (that is how she died) a body on the roof, red orbs, there was a closet upstairs that had no flooring just a bottomless hole (when you drop things down it you will never hear it hit.) If you went directly underneath it on the first floor there was no hole. Now at the location where the building was there is an eerie blackness, they have tried to grow crops there and they will not grow.
