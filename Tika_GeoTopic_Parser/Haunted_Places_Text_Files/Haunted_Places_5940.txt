Description:
Cottages 1,2,4 and 10 - Various noises late at night, several occasionsÂ voices and foot pounding coming from the attic. Over the years staff working at night have indicated the sounds of silverware being used, pool balls being used and cries from children coming from the basement and various rooms in the cottages. Several occasions some people have seen young children, shadows of people and felt hands on their bodies working during the evening hours. Overall an active hot spot for supernatural life, the buildings date back to the 1900's.
