Location: Louisiana Tech University

Description:
A ghost is said to haunt Howard Auditorium. The seats in the auditorium are spring loaded and pop back up when you get out of them. However, if you go in there alone, one seat will always be down. If you go and push the seat up, later the same seat or another one in the auditorium can be found down, as if someone were sitting in it.
