Location: Biltmore Hotel

Description:
Construction worker were fearful during the renovation of The Biltmore Hotel a historic landmark building in Miami. It was once a veteranâ€™s hospital and had other previous uses. Stories of things moving inexplicably and the sort. A receptionist who works there and lives nearby told of how once she got into the elevator and didn't press a selection and that the elevator went to one of the floors that at the time was not being used. It is known as the Bridal floor as a death occurred in a honeymooners stay. People report of seeing the bride's ghost at that floor. The fact is that the elevator was disabled to stop at that floor. Another account was of a fellow traveler whom stayed often at the hotel stayed with a colleague for 4 nights on business. The colleague said she saw people, which the fellow traveler didn't observe. The two concluded that the place was hunted. This was on a trip from Miami to NYC. This traveler was a fairly centered successful business woman who finally said that one should be more afraid of the living than the dead- which she told her colleague to subside her fears.
