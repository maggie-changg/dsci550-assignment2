Location: Normandy Church

Description:
This particular building was an old mansion back in about the 1920's or so, and was later turned into a church. They put some additions onto the house, like the chapel and the music room to make it into the church. But the original owner of the house/church is thought to still live there on the main floor. Janitor's that are working late at night have reported smelling her perfume as they clean the church.
