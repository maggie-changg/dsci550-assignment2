Location: Rose Ave

Description:
Passing Central Avenue - This road is said to be haunted by a female who was killed in a car accident. Many years ago a drunk driver hit and killed a female as she was walking down the road, dragged her body with his car hood and hit a tree, cutting her in half. It is said she asks for rides and as soon as you past her up she's in your back seat.
