Location: Mississinewa Battle Grounds/Graveyard

Description:
Upon approaching the graveyard you can see an abandoned church behind a picket fence. Further back a graveyard with about 20-30 graves, not arranged. Strange groaning and sounds coming from the woods along with actual physical contact that was witnessed by myself and others in my group. Recorded on camera non refracting light when stilled appears to be a shape of a apparition running a crossed the film. Also recorded on camera, fresh blood on tombstones that was not previously there. Other reports indicate, and witnessed by this group also, deeper into the woods in another section, places closed off by the state for unexplained reasons where strange noises can be heard coming from. Pictures and video are available for evidence.
