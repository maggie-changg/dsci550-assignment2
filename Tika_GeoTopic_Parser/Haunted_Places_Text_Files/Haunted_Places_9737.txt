Description:
In the early 1900's, a young woman hanged herself on the third floor above the restaurant. Several workers and customers have had experiences with her ghost. People have claimed to see shadows of her in a long dress and wicker baskets falling off the women's bathroom wall. Several customers have complained of cold spots and strange laughing accompanied by piano playing.
