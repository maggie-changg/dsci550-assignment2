Description:
Dry Run pond Creek Road - A small child with brown hair in a pony tail has been seen, pacing up and down the pond creek hill, and running into the woodsy area when a car comes by. Legend has it she died in the house by the hill many years ago due to a fire. You can hear her laughing and playing at night.
