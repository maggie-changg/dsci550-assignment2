Location: Old Rapid City High School

Description:
now Dakota Junior High -  The heater room said to be haunted by football coach and team that had died years ago in a plane crash. - Update: The story is in 1968 or 69, on St. Patrick’s Day, the cheerleading squad and their coaches were killed in a plane crash at Rapid City Regional Airport while returning from the state AA's boys basketball tournament in Sioux Falls. It was a private plane owned by one of the cheerleader’s father. Now there is an award given out at the state basketball tournaments every year to the cheerleading squad with the best spirit, called the Spirit of Six Award and is in honor of the 6 cheerleaders who were killed in the crash. It is the Third Floor Gym of the school, which is supposedly haunted because that is where they use.
