Description:
This road is a gravel road and it has trees surrounding it. You can't see the sky because the trees are like a dome over the road. If you turn your lights off you can't see anything. If you drive down the road you will come to another like drive way or a little road like that. Down the road about a half-mile is a school bus if you go back there you will be chased back to your car by the team that was stranded back there.
