City Hall - A heavyset man reportedly sits in the city council chamber. They call him Hal. The legend of Hal goes like this. Hal was a citizen who was extremely upset with city government. He ran for alderman of his ward.(3) He lost by a landslide to the incumbent, but Hal wasn't going to let that stop him. He attended every city meeting that was held in the chamber until he died of a heart attack at 63. Hal has been seen at least 100 times. He also has been said to walk around city hall, and former mayors have said they have seen them in their office on more than one occasion. Often times Hal is smoking a cigar.
