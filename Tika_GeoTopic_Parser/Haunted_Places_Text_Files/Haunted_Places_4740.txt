Location: old combs school

Description:
the old combs school was used for many years. Closed down in the early 1970s.for the new school that is still used today. The old abandoned school is on a hill above the new school. Its been told you can hear kids talking, teachers still give kids the lessons. Walking can be heard in the old halls. lights seen, and sights of someone in windows. The school was kindergarten to the 8th grade. it is thought principal Spicer, who died in the late 60s or early 70s.still is on the job today. The building is in poor shape, and not to safe any more. after all thatâ€™s why it was abandoned that long ago.
