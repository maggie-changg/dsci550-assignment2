Location: Saint Mary's

Description:
Saint Mary's is an old church (no longer used) which is connected to the college. A nun was walking down the first flight of stairs near the doors and had tripped and fallen to her death. From personal experience, (the doors usually arent locked), you can hear the moaning of an old woman a the bottom of the steps, but when you turn the corner, all sounds are ended.
