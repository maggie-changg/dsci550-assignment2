Location: Chavez Elementary School

Description:
Inside the main school, it is known that a former Principal and possibly a child haunts this school. From balloons passing down the halls, door knobs attempting to turn by themselves, slamming doors, and a cry or screams of a child somewhere inside the hallways of the building. The alarms go off in the building for unknown reasons late at night.
