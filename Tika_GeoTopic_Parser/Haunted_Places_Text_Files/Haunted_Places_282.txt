Location: Park

Description:
Every single time you go to the park you will see a little girl at the play ground staring at you if you stare at her for 5 seconds she will disappear. If you go and play at the park she will do anything to keep you away because she believes she owns it to her self. When you go on slides she pushes you down and gets you really scared for you to leave. When you are on a swing you feel somebody pushing you really hard she pushes you really hard you fall of and hurt your self. People say she died by a gun shot at the park on the best day of her life.
