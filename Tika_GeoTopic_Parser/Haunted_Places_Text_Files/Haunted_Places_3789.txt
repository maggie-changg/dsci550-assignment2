Location: Harper Hill

Description:
On Prospect Road Off of Hwy 49 - It's an old church and cemetery. You can feel the presence of something near you, even though you are alone. Sometimes in the upper front window you can see a misty substance in the form of a body. You can feel what's left of the floor vibrate. The tombstones are interesting also.
