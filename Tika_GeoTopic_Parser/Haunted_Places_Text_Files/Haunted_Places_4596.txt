Description:
There was a young man in the 1970's that was killed in a motorcycle accident. He ramped his motorcycle and flew out of control and landed on his head, killing him on impact. Now there have been reports of the sounds of a motorcycle engine replaying the incident. There is also red dirt where the kid landed and bashed his head open.
