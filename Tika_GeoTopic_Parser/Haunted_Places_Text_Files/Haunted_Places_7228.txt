Description:
Burpee Building - Students and staff members working late in the basement of the Burpee building have reported seeing doors rattle violently or slam shut, hearing footsteps in the hallway, and a male voice in the old radio station rooms. - November 2003 Update: Haunting believed to be caused by a guy who committed suicide. A person reportedly was working late one night and saw a reflection of him in the window. When he turned around and looked at the sound room, there was no one there. Then the papers the guy was working on blew off his desk, and the only paper that was left on the desk was an old archive article about the guy's death.
