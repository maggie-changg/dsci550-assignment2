Location: Poncha Pass

Description:
A civil war haunting is present just off the highway on the north side of the pass on a big curve, where according to Union Army records, a small contingent of troops encountered a renegade bunch of Southern soldiers running from a posse of mounted volunteers. It seems they had been sent by the South to intercept a gold shipment and take it back to Texas. They were successful in stealing the gold shipment on a wagon and had almost crossed Poncha Pass when they ran into a Union patrol form Ft Garland. A small skirmish ensued where three rebels were killed and most of the gold was retaken. Two soldiers that were wounded carried off one of the four wooden crates of gold and ran to the south up little Pemmican Creek where they disappeared for all time. Some say they left the area, and some have said they died in the dense woods and aspen groves from their wounds. The Union patrol searched for many days but could not find any trace of them. The three Southern soldiers who had been killed are buried in the Poncha Springs Little Round Top Cemetery. Local ranchers and miners have reported seeing a old man in tattered grey uniform feebly asking for help, but when they would go to help him, they could never find him. Motorists along this stretch of Hwy 285 have seen a older man in tattered clothes saluting as they passed. The sheriff was called on several occasions to investigate, but no one was ever found. Scouts and adults at the scout base along Pemmican Creek have reported seeing a strange looking grey ghostly figure in early evening while they camped out there.
