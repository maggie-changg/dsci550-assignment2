Location: Raceland Old High School

Description:
Not to be mistaken for Raceland Worthington In the basement, in the old Shop Classroom, there is a guy who wanders around mainly at 2:45 when in 1956 he cut off his hand with a table saw. People have tried to go in the old room to investigate, but they come out frightened, unable to go back in.
