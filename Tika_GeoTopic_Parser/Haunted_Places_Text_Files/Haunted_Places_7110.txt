Location: Snake Road

Description:
On this road are many stories. The stories begin with the bridges on the road. First bridge: A woman had thrown her baby into the creek. Sometimes if you stop and look over the bridge you can hear a baby cry. Around the same area, a woman had hung herself in the trees. You can see her ghostly figure by the trees hanging from a rope. - November 2003 update:The bridges have all been taken down, and the church is gone as well.
