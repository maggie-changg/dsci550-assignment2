Location: Hell's Gates (Green Mountain)

Description:
Thereâ€™s a set of big black gates that stands about a mile from the bottom of the mountain that guards some huge mansion. If you sit in front of the gates for a little while, a car will come down the mountain and chase you until you get to the bottom. When you do, the car will suddenly vanish...its no myth.
