Location: The Golf Course

Description:
apparitions are said to appear but not confirmed. Pictures produce orbs. Every night there is said to be a kid named Alex that roams around the 6th hole of the Country Club Golf Course. One night Alex was drinking with his friends and passed out and died. Now people say that every night if you go out there around 12:00 A.M. You might see Alex roaming around but you will definitely hear Alex vomiting and screaming for help. This is at the Terre Haute Country Club.
