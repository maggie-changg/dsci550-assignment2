Location: Wayside Antiques

Description:
South On I-75 -  Employees have reported to hear a voice from the back of the huge antique store call them by name, usually when they're opening or closing the store. Also, in one of the upstairs showrooms (right corner of the building facing I-75) is a antique dresser. A little girl, in period clothing, has been seen playing in the room around the dresser. She is usually only seen by psychics or those with honed psychic senses but others have reported a coldness or presence in the room. - December 2003 Update: The store is closing it's doors in the new year, 2004, right after the holidays. Whether it will open under new owners, remains to be seen.- March 2007 update: this location was closed late 2006 for re-building. The new building is almost finished and expected to open soon. - October 2007 Update: right off I-75 the famous Wayside antiques that have been closed down for some time have just been recently opened. looks the same but it is not known if it is the same owners. The only addition to the old barn like building is a huge sign above the building that says ANTIQUES, plus a new billboard advertising the place a few miles before the exit of I-75 to get there.
