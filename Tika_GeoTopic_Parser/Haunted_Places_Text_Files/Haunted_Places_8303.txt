Location: Dacula

Description:
The Old Mill - Off of Alcovy Road in Decula, Georgia, cars that pass by the abandoned mill see a light in the top story of the abandoned building turn on when you drive by with the reflection of a man in the window. The Mill is right off of a creek that has a bridge going over it, and if you stop on the bridge, you can see the appearance of a green glow coming from the woods behind the mill.
