Location: Northern School Supply Warehouse

Description:
This building, built around 1910, is haunted by the ghost of a small boy who fell down the elevator shaft many years ago. People working there late at night have reported hearing a child crying from inside the elevator shaft, sounds of running feet, and the apparition of a small boy who will appear and stand there staring at you.
