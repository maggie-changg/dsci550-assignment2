Location: Centennial Hall

Description:
Two spirits are known to haunt this theater. One is a woman wearing a long white dress from an earlier time. The man is thought to be a patron who died of a heart attack in the 1950â€™s. The woman has been seen frequently in the upper balcony seats, in an area that was once a balcony but is now sealed off. She has also been seen in the green room. She is very protective over her space and has been known to push employees down the halls and stairs. The man seems to be the counter balance and helps anyone who has been injured by the woman.
