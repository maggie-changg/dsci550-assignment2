Location: Crybaby Bridge/ Whitesville Road

Description:
It is the third bridge off Whitesville Road deep in the woods. The story goes two ways: a woman either drowned her child in the creek or the child drowned accidentally. If you turn off your car engine while sitting on that bridge sometimes it will not come back on. You will also hear a baby crying (hence the name). People have also sighted a figure in white walking through the woods near the bridge.
