Description:
Was an old hideout in the 1930's for the prohibition period. Reports by owners of footsteps in the night. Turned over pop and beer bottles upon cleaning after hours. Have an actual picture of ghost taken from wear of building. Picture was of a male figure's shadow on wall, but no body was visible! Had picture blown up for locals to see!!
