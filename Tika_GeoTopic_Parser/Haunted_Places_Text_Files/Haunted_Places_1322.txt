Location: Lucky Lanes Bowling

Description:
The Rotundra - This bowling alley that is still open used to be a movie theatre. It used to be called The York Theatre. A long time ago someone planted a bomb in the theatre, which blew up and killed a lot of people. At night when closing the bowling alley you can hear the children that were killed laughing. You can also hear footsteps upstairs where the old theatres where.
