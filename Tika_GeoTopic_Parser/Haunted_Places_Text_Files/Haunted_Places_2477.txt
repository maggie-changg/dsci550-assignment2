Location: Save-Mart Supermarkets

Description:
Staff of Save Mart Supermarkets in Chowchilla California have reported A woman who used to work the Graveyard shift for janitorial stated that on the nights that she was alone with the night stockers that she would feel a presence through out the aisles, or in the upstairs break room. One young man who used to work there stated that he had the same feeling, but he worked the swing shift and only felt the presence in the break room. The young man said that every Saturday was when no one worked the grave yard shift and the store is totally empty....well, not all the time. Some people have said they would see someone walking around the store on Saturday nights, around 2:00am. They would also see shadows from a distance as if there is someone walking around inside.
