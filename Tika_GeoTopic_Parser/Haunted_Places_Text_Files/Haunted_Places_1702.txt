Location: Newpark Mall

Description:
In the TILT arcade doors won't unlock and appear to be stuck. At night when workers used to turn off all the games in the brake rooms (there are two of them) some of them would switch back on when turned off no one else was there to do so. One of the workers spent the night there after working late one night and heard a little girl screaming in his ear. Always having the feeling of being watched when alone. Some of people that have been there say they have seen a little girl in the emergency exit door way and just disappears through it.
