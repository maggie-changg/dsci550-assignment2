Location: Central Middle School

Description:
There are apparently more than one ghost. There is the lady in old fashioned clothing. She has been seen by several people since remodeling was done on this historical school. There is a ghost that likes to turn on music. A substitute who didn't know the school was haunted had quite a time with that one! Every time she'd leave the room the CD player or radio would come on. And there is also a male ghost. Students have seen the “ghost man,” coming silently down the hall and turn into the boys restroom. Rumor is that several night custodians have transferred or quit rather than work the night shift at this school.
