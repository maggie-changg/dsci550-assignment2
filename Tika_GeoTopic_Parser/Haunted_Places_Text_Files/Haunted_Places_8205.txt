Location: Oakland Cemetery

Description:
This cemetery is the resting place for 3,000 to 4,500 confederate soldiers that died during Sherman's Invasion of Atlanta. In one section of the cemetery is a statue of a large wounded lion in honor of The Unknown Confederate Soldier. People hear a disembodied voice giving "The Roll Call of Dead", somberly calling out the names of the long dead soldiers.
