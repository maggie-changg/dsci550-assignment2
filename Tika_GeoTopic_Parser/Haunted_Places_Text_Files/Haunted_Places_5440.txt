Location: Gulf Road

Description:
a very steep and twisted road in the middle of a dense forest, whose trees come right up to the side of the road. Sightings from driving down the very creepy road at night include seeing a burning cross in the woods, headlights making the shadow of a woman standing on the side of the road (with nobody there to make the shadow), and unknown noises and sightings of spirits.
