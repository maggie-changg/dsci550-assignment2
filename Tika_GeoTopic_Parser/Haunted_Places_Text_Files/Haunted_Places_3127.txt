Location: Prince Georges county

Description:
NASA/GSFC - Bldg #11 - feel as if someone is watching you...or will pop up right around the corner if no one is around! Late one night a guard was doing his rounds, when he was waiting for an elevator. he heard voices and laughter coming from the approaching elevator when it opened no one was there...he refused to ever go in the building again! Also a extreme feel of dread falls over you if you are alone!
