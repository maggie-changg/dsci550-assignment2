Location: St. Mary's Cemetery

Description:
Is said to be haunted by three World War I & II soldiers. People walking or driving by who look in the cemetery see three dark figures standing and when they look back the three soldiers are gone. Other residents who visit the cemetery say they've felt cold spots in the area where the soldiers were buried. Also while walking by the graves people have heard the sound of running feet on leaves and only to find no one there.
