Location: Stucky's Bridge

Description:
During about the 1800's a man named Stucky let travelers in the night stay in his house. While they slept Stucky would kill them then rob them of their valuables and then bury the bodies along the riverbank near his house. Some of the locals found out and hung Stucky on the bridge next to the riverbank where he buried all of the travelers. Late at night you can hear a splash coming from the water underneath the bridge where they cut the rope and his body hit the water and there is supposedly a spot that glows where his body can be found. Sometimes you can even see something walking on the bridge or even catch a glimpse of his body hanging from the bridge.
