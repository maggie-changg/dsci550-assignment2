Description:
In the girls P.E. locker room, the toilets flush, the blow-dryers turn on, and the lockers open all by themselves. The school was built on a piece of land that used to be a farm. On the farm, the father ran over his own daughter with the tractor, killing her. The ghost of the little girl never left.
