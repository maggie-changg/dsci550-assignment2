Location: Orchard Supply Hardware

Description:
There is a story of girl being murdered and raped in the warehouse area of the store 1 yr before it became Orchard. Employees have seen a figure walking and she is heard footsteps that seem to be the sound of high heels (No one wears high heels), screaming and laughing, as well as boxes moving. She likes to blow in men's ears and girls with long hair often feel a slight tug. One report of a worker that had just shrunk wrapped a pallet. The power went out and there is a 5 sec delay for the generator to kick on in that 5 sec something completely unwrapped the pallet.
