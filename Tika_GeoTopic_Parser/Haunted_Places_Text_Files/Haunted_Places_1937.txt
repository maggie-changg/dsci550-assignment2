Location: Mount Rubidoux

Description:
between the hours of 1-3am on the east end of the mountain. Strange figures have been seen running and hiding as if playing a game, in groups of three. They have been described as elves/little people. They are known to throw small rocks in your direction, and stack small piles of rocks in a path you just have taken.
