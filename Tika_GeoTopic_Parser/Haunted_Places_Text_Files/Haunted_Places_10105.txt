Description:
Jerde Hall - A few students who live on the fourth floor of Jerde Hall have relayed different but very similar accounts of a little girl who appears occasionally.  One student saw her reflected in the mirror, but turned to look and she was gone.  Another student walked down the hall and heard a child's voice whisper her name.  She turned to look at the empty hallway and heard the delighted giggling of the absent girl.  Still another student woke up in the middle of the night to see the little girl sitting on the end of her bed.  The phantom girl raised her finger to her lips as if to say, "Shhh..."  The student screamed and the little girl ran out of the room, slamming the door loudly behind her.
