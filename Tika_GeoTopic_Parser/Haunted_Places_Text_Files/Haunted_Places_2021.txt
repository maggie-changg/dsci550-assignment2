Location: San Remo Hotel

Description:
The Hotel was reportedly a brothel owned by a Madame. She reportedly haunts room 33. She has been known to knock on doors of the hallway the room is in, and when people open the doors after repeated knocks, no one is around. There is also reports of a little girl roaming the hallways and trying to get into room #42. It is actually an amazing hotel, and a great place to stay in with large groups of people (cheap too). There are always cold spots to be felt, and the sense of someone watching, it's a calming feeling, not creepy at all!
