Location: Heilbron Mansion

Description:
This mansion sits on the corner of Painters Crossing and Rose Tree Road. It is Haunted by 3 different ghosts, 1 is a little girl that haunts the upstairs, one is her mother whose presence can be felt in the Library, the grand staircase, and upstairs hallway, and the third is a slave that was hung in a tree outside who haunts the driveway and front porch. There is a book written about the house called "Night Stalks the Mansion" the book is out of print though, so it is hard to find copies of it.
