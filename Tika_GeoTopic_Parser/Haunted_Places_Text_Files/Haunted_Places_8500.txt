Location: Conroe

Description:
CISD Administration Building - Formerly Sadler Hospital - now offices for the Conroe school district. Double doors swing open for no reason (not electric). Sounds like someone whistling a tune, when no one in the room with you. Toilets flush for no reason. Deceased loved ones perfume filling the room.
