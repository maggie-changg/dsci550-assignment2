Location: Judson College

Description:
Kirtley Hall - Room 313 is haunted by two different ghosts. One is Anne Kirtley herself, and the other is a girl who supposedly killed herself in that room. The doors and windows shake, there are cold spots and more often than not, the entire room is a "cold spot".
