Location: Melody Inn

Description:
On the southeast corner of Harbor and Commonwealth where the old Melody Inn was destroyed by fire in the 80’s an image of the former owner’s father appears with a box of matches. The ghost of Mr. Melody has actually been known to provide a light of a smoke to customers outside the new businesses and then smiles and vanishes.
