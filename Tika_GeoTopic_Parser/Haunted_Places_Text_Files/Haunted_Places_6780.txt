Description:
Crane Cemetery down the road from the abandoned Crane school - In the cemetery there is a headstone that glows only on certain nights. As soon as you enter the cemetery, turn off your headlights and drive straight. Look straight ahead and you will see a headstone start to glow then stop glowing as you get closer. Also when you leave the cemetery, look back and it will start to glow again.
