Location: Ghost Creek Rd

Description:
Legend has it that a couple was engaged many years ago.  On the night of their wedding, the young man died in a car crash on this bridge.  If you turn your car off and walk around clockwise it will not start.  There will be a white apparition in the trees.  The local newspaper has done many stories on this.
