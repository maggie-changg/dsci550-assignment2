Bower's Mansion - Mrs. Bower's, who died penniless after her husband died, is said to haunt the second floor of the house. She used to conduct SÃ©ances in the parlor after her husband died, in an attempt to contact him. The Graveyard on the hillside behind the Mansion has also been a spot of numerous sightings of glowing figures on moonless nights.
