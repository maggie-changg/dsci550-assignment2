Location: Cabrini College

Description:
Used to be an estate owned by John Dorrance, and his daughter. It is said that his daughter fell in love with Xavier, who was the stable boy. (Xavier Hall is the name of one of the dormitories there.) The Dorrances were quite wealthy, and John did not permit his daughter to see Xavier any longer. Xavier hung himself in Grace Hall, which used to be a stable. Mr. Dorrance's beloved daughter threw herself over the balcony in the mansion. She is often seen wearing a blue or white dress, and has long blonde hair. On the night of the first snowfall she can be found in front of Woodcrest, looking for her child that she killed. Mr. Dorrance can be seen walking on one of the driveways. He wears a top hat and a long black cape. Students driving on this driveway have seen him as a solid person who seems to appear from nowhere in front of the car. Whomever is driving hits, and runs him over. (The impact has been felt by the passengers and driver) When the driver gets out to see who they hit and to survey the damage to the car, there is no one behind the car, no damage to the car, but there are footprints in the snow along the driveway.
