Location: Old Western Wood Mall

Description:
During renovation in 1998-99, a security guard reported to his supervisor that when he passed through a doorway back to where fitting rooms used to be, the ambient air temperature dropped about 20 degrees and there was a definite presence. The supervisor mentioned that she'd noticed this herself and not to repeat this information to anyone. Being a practicing witch, the guard returned the next night and attempted to contact the presence. Using a pendulum, he tracked the "source" to a sub-basement containing a water heater and meters. SOMETHING had happened there, but he was unable to a certain exactly what. Nicknaming the presence "Charlie", he became accustomed to being "escorted" on his rounds through that section of the building.
