Description:
It is known that tunnels were built in the 1940's connecting Buette Des Mortes school and Menasha H.S. together incase of a Nuclear Attack. During a school drill four kids got locked in the tunnel while trying to ditch school. You can hear them screaming, pounding on the doors, and yelling for help.
