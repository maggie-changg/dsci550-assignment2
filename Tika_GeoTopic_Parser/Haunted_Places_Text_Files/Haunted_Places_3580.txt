Location: Myrtles Plantation

Description:
The ghost of a murderous slave is seen and heard, a mother and her two daughters are seen there, and i have personally seen and heard the daughters, a confederate soldier walks there, a crying woman, reenactment of the murder on the stairwell can be heard, the piano plays by itself, footsteps when not a living soul is around, voices, doors open and close by themselves and people who sleep there, like me, have been grabbed by someone and had their legs rubbed in a massaging motion or have been tucked into bed so tight that they can hardly get free.
