Location: Cold-Water Rd â€“ Wal-Mart

Description:
Around 3am-4am in the morning, shoppers and workers hear bagpipes playing a scotish tune. Shortly when song ends, a man in a green plaid kilt makes his appearance by pacing the floors. When he walks by you, you will get a cold eerie feeling. This ghost is known to be friendly.
