Description:
The Newborn Nursery is haunted by a woman in white. A room in the Special Care Nursery is known for suddenly becoming cold and furniture and equipment is known to move by itself. A crying baby is sometimes heard in the third unused Nursery. A room in the postpartum ward is known for a rocking chair that rocks by itself and a toilet that flushes by itself. The hospital operator one night received a phone call from a patient room the voice on the other end requested that she send "help"---the room was in a closed down, unused ward and had no telephone.
