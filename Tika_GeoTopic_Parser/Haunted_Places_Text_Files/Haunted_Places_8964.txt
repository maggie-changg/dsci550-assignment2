Location: El Paso Museum of Art

Description:
It was located on Montana Street, but now they moved it to the Downtown area of El Paso. Old woman was sited on various times looking at you from a window on the top floors. Lights would flicker on and off. Doors would open and shut. Moaning sounds were heard coming from the basement.
