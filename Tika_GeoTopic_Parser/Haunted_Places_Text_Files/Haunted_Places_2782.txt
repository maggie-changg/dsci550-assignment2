Location: Fleming Middle School

Description:
The students share a legend of a haunting by saying that one of the bathrooms is haunted. Someone supposedly died there and now you can see her face in the mirror. - March 2007 update/correction. The school was built in the 1920's and it was a six-year school when the new high school was built it took the name Narbone so the old school had to come up with a new name. This is probably all urban myth. There are other stories one is about a elevator that went up to the third floor, but there is no elevator. One thing is that the school was built in the 1920's and that the school's name was changed to honor Alexander Fleming. The submitter does not remember the school's original name but the name change occurred in the 1940's. The third floor can only be reached by a rather steep set of stairs. The third floor was seldom used because of this fact. There is one hallway up there with about 20 rooms in total, 10 on each side of the hall. Some classes where held on the third floor but it was mostly unused.
