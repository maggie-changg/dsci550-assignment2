Location: Desert Views Ranch

Description:
There is a young girl dressed in prairie clothes, wearing a white apron, that wanders in the area of the old chicken coop and horse corral. She is said to have died from a fever. She will sometimes laugh, and be seen standing by an old tree. Younger children have talked to her, and have said her name is Lillian.
