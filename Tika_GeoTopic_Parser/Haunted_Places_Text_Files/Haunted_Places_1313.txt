Location: West End House Boys and Girls Club

Description:
Originally Built in the 1930's it was primarily a Jewish club for older men to come and exercise. Ghosts of these elder men still exercise with the teens from today. Unknown splashes and bubbles in the pool, showers in the locker room turning on by themselves and lockers opening and closing by themselves.
