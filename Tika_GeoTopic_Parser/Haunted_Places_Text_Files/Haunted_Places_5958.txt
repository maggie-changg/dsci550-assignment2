Location: Molly's Rock on Pine Lake Rd.

Description:
A ghost by the name of Molly haunts the rock and every time someone drives by the rock, there is a halo resting above. If someone were to go onto the rock and either be drinking or drunk, story has it that Molly will scream out a long screeching noise and say, "get off my rock" and the person will get pushed off.
