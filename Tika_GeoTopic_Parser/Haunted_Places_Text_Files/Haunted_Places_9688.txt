Location: Old City Gates

Description:
As the story goes, at the time an epidemic of Yellow Fever was going around and a little girl about 13 or 14 years old wearing a white dress was found dead by the City Gates. No one claimed her. But sometimes around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning you may see her dancing on the Old City Gates. - October 2004 update: her name is believed to be Elizabeth.
