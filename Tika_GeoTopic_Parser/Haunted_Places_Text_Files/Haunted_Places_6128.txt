Description:
The Farmer -  Construction began in 1932 over family farmland on the south side of the city that was owned by a family (buried in a small, private cemetary on SW 31st St) who lost their land against their will. Since the basement was constructed, shadows and the image of a malicious looking middle aged man in farm attire. have been witnessed by various individuals. Moans, foot steps and stomping, shadows, images and cold spots are his style.
