Location: Lakeside School

Description:
In the Basement you get creepy feelings. The lights in the Auditorium will sway. Pentagrams will be scratched into the ten-foot tall ceiling. Things will fly across the room. You can see a ghost of a man with dark brown curly hair in a racecar uniform. You can also sometimes see soldiers.
