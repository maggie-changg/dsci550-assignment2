Location: Boatyard Village

Description:
One couple report visiting the museum to old warplanes sit. “One day, we went to see the planes and there was a B52 bomber with a man sitting inside it. He smiled at me and waved and I told my fiancée to take a picture. We thought it was great they put on a show with men dressed the part like soldiers of the war. As we left, we told the keeper what a great idea that was. He didn't know what we were talking about; telling us no one sits in any of the planes. We ran back to look again but there was no one there. When the pictures were developed, there was only a bright light where the man was sitting, as if the sun reflected off the window.” - May 2004 Additional information: this area is no longer accessible to the public.
