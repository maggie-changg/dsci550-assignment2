Location: Family Tree Restaurant

Description:
Before the building was redone and turned into a restaurant a little boy drown in a canal that ran through the back. People see and hear things on a monthly basis. Whether it be the doorbells sticking straight in the air and ringing or a lady in blue walking into the backrooms. If you are lucky you might even hear or see a pot slam into a wall.
