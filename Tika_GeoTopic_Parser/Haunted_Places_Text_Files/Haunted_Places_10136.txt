Location: old cemetery

Description:
The old cemetery overlooking Mt. Rushmore is a burial for many of the mine workers and people who died working on Mt. Rushmore. If you bring a video camera you can catch faces in the video camera and white figures hanging from the trees even though you can't see them with the naked eye.
