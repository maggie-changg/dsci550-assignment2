Description:
Some of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's original works are kept in the old Library on campus. She has been seen walking the halls at night holding a candle, wearing a white gown. Residents have seen her in the top floor window peering outside at us. Also, a statue of her sits out in front of the library. Her arms are at her sides, however, some nights the shadow that was cast on to the library behind her showed her arms held up high above her head.
