Location: Old Hershberger Road

Description:
Back a long time ago, it is said that a schoolhouse was located in here where students would go to learn.  One boy named Henry, who was very young, fell in a boiler and was burnt to death.  He now haunts the road.  Strange noises were heard like creaks and loud bangs.  Also, a man was murdered back in the woods of Hollsopple.
