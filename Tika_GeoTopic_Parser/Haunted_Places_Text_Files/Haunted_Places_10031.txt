Description:
Old residence hall  - locked up now, but there is no electricity to it, yet every night a light shines. Electricians have tried to find a power source, and never have. - May 2004 Update: A graduate from SLU reports to have no recollection or any unused residence halls or buildings on campus. The post may either be outdated or just not true.
