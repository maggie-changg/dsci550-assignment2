Location: Olde Town Playhouse

Description:
The Playhouse was once a church.  There was either and accident or a suicide that today results in the organist/piano player haunting the Playhouse.  He mostly plays tricks as he will turn lights on and off just to get a laugh or two.  Some even say they can hear his music at night.
