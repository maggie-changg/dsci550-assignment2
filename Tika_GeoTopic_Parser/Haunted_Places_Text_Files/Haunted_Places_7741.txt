Location: St. Michael's College

Description:
There are a couple of places on campus that seem to have ghostly visitors. 1) The theater supposedly is haunted by a nun who assists actors. There have also been incidents reported during performances of props disappearing with no explanation. 2) The men's' first year dormitory also an evil presence. in the 60s or 70s, young men were holding some sort of occult meetings One of the men insisted that he needed to close the "portal" before they left, but by that time security was there and they tossed them off campus. the door to the attic is padlocked shut. However, lights go on in the attic and footsteps are heard in the middle of the night by the residents on the top floor. The image of the pentagram still exists on the floor despite attempts to replace the wood.
