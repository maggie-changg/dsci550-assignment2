Location: The Whaley House

Description:
haunted by Thomas Whaley & it is believed there are others. This house was once the city's courtroom. The haunting extens beyond Thomas Whaley and to a man hanged just outside the house. He was hung for stealing a boat. One visitor strongly felt the presence of a woman while touring the house, in one of the upstairs bedrooms. â€œIt was not frightening...the presence was actually welcoming. There are tours in this place.
