Description:
Ceres Hall - There have been many weird happenings on the 3rd floor of this building, most believe that it has to do with a man who hung himself from a heating pipe during WW II. In the basement: hairs stand up on the back of the neck, a strong feeling of fear forms in the stomach and the "fight or flight" instinct kicks in with most people leaving the basement in a hurry. The presence and sense of evil is much stronger in the basement than on the third floor which seems to have a separate entity occupying it.
