Location: Ambassador Hotel

Description:
Last year, during the filming of VH-1's "Random Play" several crewmembers reported seeing a ghostly figure appear in a fourth story window, lean and out and then disappear. Also, lights would inexplicably turn on and off. Strange cold spots were felt and "shooting lights" were seen in hallways.
