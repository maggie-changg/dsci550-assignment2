Location: Old State Penitentiary

Description:
Now housing Louisiana State Police Headquarters and Barracks this place is a veritable hotspot of ghostly activity. The old execution chambers and morgue now house offices and the main two story building is located over a basement of some sort which is always dark and seeps with water due to the high water table in Louisiana. Employees have experienced the sound of footsteps on numerous occasions, which upon close examination could have no earthly explanation. Other phenomenon includes radios turning themselves on and off and dark spaces, which take on malignant life of their own.
