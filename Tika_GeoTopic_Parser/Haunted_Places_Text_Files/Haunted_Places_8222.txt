Location: Hardin Bridge Road

Description:
Stories from around here say that a couple was driving across the single lane bridge one night when headlight of another car appeared on the other side of the bridge instead of backing up he turned the car off the bridge and landed in the water below. If you walk across the bridge you will hear voices and screams and you'll get about half way across the bridge and see headlights coming toward the bridge hitting the bank on the other side of the bridge but they never make it to the bridge. - March 2008 update: has been indefinitely closed due to safety issues. They are possibly putting up a modern bridge.
