Location: Jefferson Middle School

Description:
in 1950's a girl died in this building! She was looking for her little brother and someone had killed her. Know one knows who. Many kids who attend this school around 1995 and up say they have seen the little girl in a white dress wandering around the halls saying, "bobby, where are you!!" Also they see a man with no head in this long dark black coat into class rooms and then things fall and big booms with out a reason.
