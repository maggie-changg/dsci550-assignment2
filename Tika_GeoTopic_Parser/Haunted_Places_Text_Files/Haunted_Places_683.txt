Location: Dixmont Mental Institution

Description:
Used for mentally challenged patients in the 1800's and was taken over in a rebellion by the patients. Since, apparitions can be seen wandering the grounds, lights flicker, unexplained noises, doors slamming, cold spots add to the already eerie feeling.- December 2003 Update: There is a house where a security guard lives near the site. He will give you permission to walk around up there but only in daylight hours. During the night you it will be considered trespassing. - April 2007 Update - This was tore down to make room for a new Wal-Mart.
