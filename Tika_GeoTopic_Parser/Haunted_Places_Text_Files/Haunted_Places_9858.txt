Description:
Witnesses have heard a an inhuman howling in the woods next to the graveyard, a ghost lady, tall, w/ a long fancy gown and a big dress hat. There has been a glowing ball seen by numerous people that circles the steeple of the church at the graveyard and we have also heard the windows rattling by themselves.
