Location: Wissahickon Canoe Club

Description:
Originally a mill in the 1600's, this creek-side building is said to have many ghosts.  The presence of a young woman, the miller's reclusive daughter, can be felt in an upstairs bedroom, with the protective presence of many dogs she owned around the bed area where they would sleep.  A mirror in that room mysteriously never collects dust.  Poltergeist activity has been reported with kitchen appliances suddenly switching on or off, and lights flickering.
