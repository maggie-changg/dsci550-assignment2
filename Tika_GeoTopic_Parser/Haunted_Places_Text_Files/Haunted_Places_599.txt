Location: The Black Cross

Description:
Rumor has it that in the late 1800's a horrible flu epidemic went through the area of Butler/Kittanning. At the time, there were a bunch of immigrant workers here who all contracted this flu and died. Instead of being buried in individual graves, these immigrants were thrown into a mass grave pit that had been dug out in the woods. An enormous black cross was erected on top. At night, it is told that you can hear unearthly howling at this spot; also a strong wind and mist are reported.
