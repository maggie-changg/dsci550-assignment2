Location: Palmetto Thickets &amp; Woods

Description:
This immediate area in and around West Columbia and the old settlement of East Columbia and the surrounding woods and palmetto thickets abounds in ghost tales. There is the lady in the gray taffeta dress, and the ghost hounds of Orizimbo Plantation where Santa Ana was detained, who still wait for the return of the deceased owner of the plantation. They were reported to have been seen recently. Many other stories also float like wisps in the wind. This is one of the oldest parts on Texas to be settled, originally a part of Austin's Colony, so these are old "haunts".
