Location: Charles Loof Carousel

Description:
The Charles Loof Carousel, also known as Crescent Park Carousel is over 100 years old and at once had an amusement park, and a ballroom. Now all that is left is the Carousel because in the 1960's the Ballroom burned to the ground. Its has been said that people were burned to death in this fire. An employee reports when she opens up in the morning, sometimes the music turns on without anyone else being there and the lights flicker. They also report seeing woman in bellhooped skirts walking around down near the water. There also used to be train tracks where now is the bike path. At night you can hear the trains and see lights flashing wildly. Not only has all of this happened in the past in this small town but at the Crescent Park beach a man murdered his wife in 1989 and buried her in the sand. Whenever you go to sit near where he had buried her, you get a feeling of anger and you feel like your freezing up because of a coldness that hits you.
