Description:
Gardiner Hall - a Home Coming Queen who slipped in the shower and died from a head wound. She usually walks across the football field at midnight on the anniversary of her death, but she has been seen in the third floor bathroom where she fell. - March 2007 Update/Correction: The homecoming queen who is said to haunt the area did not slip in the shower. It happened in 1961 and she fell from a balance beam during gym. The doctor examined her, said she was fine and she returned to the dorm. Consequently, she died in her sleep from an undiagnosed head injury. At one time, there was a plaque in the old gym, dedicated to her.
