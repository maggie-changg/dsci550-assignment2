Location: Otter River State Forest Cemetery

Description:
Off New Boston Road. a rather large cemetery with stone posts and chain, large religious figure on wall.  if backed up to certain tree a figure is seen hanging from tree limb. Supposedly angry.   Rumors of saying "Rudy give me a sign" being key words in this area.  Strange feelings on one's self even when passing.
