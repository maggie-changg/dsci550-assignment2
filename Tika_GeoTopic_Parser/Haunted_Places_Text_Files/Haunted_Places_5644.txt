Location: Subway

Description:
If you go downstairs after 9pm all sorts of mischief begins. Things will fly off the shelves and clatter to the floor. An extreme stench will fill the building. The beepers for the doors will continuously go off. Usually that is the extent of it, but once in a while they get really restless. On those occasions you may hear your name called out though no one is there. A couple of employees have reported seeing a skinny woman in a dress about fifty or so years old standing by the register frowning at them and when they attempted to approach her she vanished.
