Location: Main Street

Description:
It has been said that a while ago, a man got run over when the streets were first being settled. The man has been seen walking near shops, and he has also been seen wandering around North Middle School, and the schools' properties around the Menomonee Falls area. The man is tall with darker features, and has a long beard. From time to time, people say at night you can hear the man murmuring as he walks around Main Street, and he has also been known to screw around with the Main Street clock. Rumor has it that the man was also involved with the burning down of a bar several years ago right along Main Street.
