Location: North High School

Description:
The Stage in the auditorium is haunted by the ghosts of two children, a boy, and a girl. Before the school was built there, it was a graveyard to the children's home across the field. All of the graves were moved to not to far away, to accommodate the school, but somehow, two tombstones were lost, maybe even the graves themselves. These graves were located where the stage is now, that is all that is known. Legend says, and it is commonly believed that the graves were left there, but this is not 100% known. Today, there has been sightings, (even by me) of a boy playing on the catwalk, and you can here little footsteps and laughs like children playing there; a boy and a girl.
