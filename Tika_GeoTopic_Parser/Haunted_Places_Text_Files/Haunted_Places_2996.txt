Location: Hooters Restaurant, Gotham and The New West Nightclub (now closed)

Description:
Strange presences and energies felt.(Gotham and the New West are both closed down now, due to a gang-related shooting last summer that led to someone's death.)There are reports of cold chills, and the strong presence of a spirit who would follow you throughout the back part of the club. A former worker at the club says he was working the closing shift with a few other employees, finishing up for the night. It was around three or four in the morning. He had his back facing the front door, when all of a sudden he felt the sensation of a human being coming right towards him. He turned around and immediately swung out his fist instinctively. He says that nobody was there, and that "something" went right through him.
