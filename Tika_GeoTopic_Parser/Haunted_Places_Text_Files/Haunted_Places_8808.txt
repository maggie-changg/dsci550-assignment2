Location: Spaghetti Warehouse

Description:
It is said that the second floor of this building is haunted. This was where the employees break room was. As some employees would walk up the stairs to the break room, they would hear strange noises coming from above them. Some of them were so terrified; they refused to go up there. - February 2004 update: A former worker at the spaghetti warehouse in Austin, reports there have been numerous occasions when the lights begin to flicker on and off throughout the restaurant. The basement though is where a lot of the employees don't like to go because of the fact it has a strong presence of someone watching you that sends chills down your spine.
