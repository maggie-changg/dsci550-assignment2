Location: Mt Zion Cemetery

Description:
A church burnt down on this site while in session. The bodies of the victims were buried on the site. Late at night you can hear girls giggling and a sharp whistling noise. Also, there is always a brisk breeze in the area. The preachers tombstone is by a tree in the back ground and legend has it that if you knock on this tree, the echo goes down the roots and to the preachers body and he shrieks very quickly.
