Location: The Old Hospital Building downtown

Description:
Located downtown, the hospital was originally established as a sanitarium for victims of tuberculosis. It was the main hospital until the early 1980s when a new building was built. Until recently, it served as a nursing home. On the 4th floor, which originally served as the maternity ward, sounds of crying babies floated through the halls. There are reports of a child running through the halls as well.
