Description:
New Castle House - On New Castle Road in Gardendale/Morris there is this old house that is believed to be haunted by several spirits, one in particular. Her name is Melissa, and is thought to have lived on the land before the house was built. She roams around a lot in the yard by a catfish pond that is in the front of the house. Some believe she lost a loved one in that pond. The ghost of Melissa will try to befriend anyone who has lived in the house that has children, and try to lure them to the pond at night.
