Description:
Bell Tower - From the bell tower of the church people often will feel someone watching them while walking past the building. The building has a basement that has a section that has been sealed off, for reasons unknown. Most feel that whatever is behind those sealed off walls can explain the spirit that haunts Hiawatha Hall.
