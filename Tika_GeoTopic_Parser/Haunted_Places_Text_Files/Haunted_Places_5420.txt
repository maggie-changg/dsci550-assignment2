Location: Medaille College

Description:
This has been said that this school formerly called: School For Boys. It is being haunted by former students who attend & that they appear as normal like kids today, but in searching for teachers, sitting in classrooms in their 1944 clothing attire, behaving themselves while the teachers are teaching.
