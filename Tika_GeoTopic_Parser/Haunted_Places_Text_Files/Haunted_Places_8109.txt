Location: Kearney Area Children's Museum

Description:
The basement of the Children's Museum in Kearney is very heavily haunted. It is full of strange equipment, and has very odd-colored stains on the walls. Sudden temperature drop, hairs all over standing on end and a generally very, very bad feeling were experienced.
