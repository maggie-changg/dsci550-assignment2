Location: Candy Cane Park

Description:
A.K.A. Hatchet Park - Reports of the merry-go-round being haunted and cursed by a woman.- December 2003 correction: a woman was killed in the park years ago. She was found in the grass, still alive but someone had tried to chop the top of her head off- with a hatchet. That park doesnâ€™t have a merry-go-round anymore, but it's said that you can see her sitting on one of the benches or swings at it. - February 2004 Update about Merry-go-round. Another submitter reports there used to be a merry-go-round until it was removed a short time ago. The woman did haunt the merry-go-round throwing people off and making it spin out of control. Since the removal of the merry-go-round, the woman is said to haunt the park benches.
