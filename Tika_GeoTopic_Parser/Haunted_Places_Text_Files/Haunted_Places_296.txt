Description:
Thomas Fine Arts Building - The Forrest Roberts theater and Thomas fine arts building are connected by a service corridor. The elevator moves it's self from floor to floor empty as if being called. It only does this at night. It has also stopped for several seconds while people were using it in the day. It is believed that Perry haunts both buildings, and possibly even the McClintoc building, which is also connected.
