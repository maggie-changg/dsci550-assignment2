Location: Spook Hill Inn- Near the battle site Antietham there is a stretch of road that leads out of Boonsboro and towards several Civil War battle sites. If you drive your vehicle to the base of the steep hill and put your vehicle in neutral the Ghosts of confederate army men will push your vehicle back up the slight incline towards Boonsboro. It is said they are pushing cannons and artillery pieces. Sometimes you can hear laughter from the woods.

Description:
March 2004 update: There was recently a video made that was aired on TV, and included many ghost stories about the Washington County area. The video is named "Legends," and can be ordered through Antietam Cable Television, and can sometimes be found in video rental facilities.
