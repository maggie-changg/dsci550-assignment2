Description:
Dorm L - is also haunted by an old military nurse. Not sure if it's the same one that is in the TB dorm but this one walks down the hall. E dorm (the dorm I am in) is haunted by three spirits. One of them is a little girl, age between 5-6, who stands by the doorway of the entrance to the dorm. Others have experienced this girl walking down the hall bouncing a ball. The other ghost is possibly a former RA (residential adviser). You can see him walking down the hall making sure all the students are in their dorm. The third one is an unknown spirit, possibly an old student who died in that dorm about nine months ago."
