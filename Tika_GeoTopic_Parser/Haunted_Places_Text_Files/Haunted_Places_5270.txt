Description:
Hiawatha Hall - is the oldest building on the campus and was built by the Methodist church in order to bring Christianity to the Native children. The church has been closed for decades and possession of the building has been assumed by the Government and is on the National record of historic places. It is said to be home of a spirit that makes no effort to hide itself. Doors will open and close for no reason, even while propped open with an object.
