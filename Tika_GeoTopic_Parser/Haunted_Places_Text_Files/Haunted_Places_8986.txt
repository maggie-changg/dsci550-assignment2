Location: Thunderbird Road

Description:
When driving down thunderbird towards Mesa St. you will come upon a downward sloping hill. Go down the hill to the point where there is a slight upwards slope, stop, put your car in neutral and turn off the lights. After a couple seconds you will begin to roll up the slope with your speed increasing the longer you let it roll (you do eventually start going downhill again, so i suggest you stop your car at the top of the slope). Not sure if it's a ghost or not, but it is abnormal.
