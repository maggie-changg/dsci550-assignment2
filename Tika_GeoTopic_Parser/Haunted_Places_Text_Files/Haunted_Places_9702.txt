Location: The Don CeSar Beach Resort and Spa

Description:
The Don CeSar Resort was once the private residence of Thomas Rowe. He had studied in London during his youth and fell in love with a girl named Lucinda. Her parents sent her away however, so when Thomas returned home, he never saw her again. He built the castle to look like the one where they met. His ghost can be seen walking hand-in-hand with a beautiful dark-haired woman along the shore.
