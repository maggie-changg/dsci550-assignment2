Description:
Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity House - For years brothers of the fraternity have heard unexplained noises and footsteps throughout the entire house. The apparition of a man appeared in the attack, then vanished. Some students have reported being held face first in their pillow by invisible forces or have felt something sit at the bottom of their bed. The house use to be part of the underground railroad and has had several individuals die within in its doors. People hanging, children playing, choking feelings at night, and many documented past events of people coming to their untimely death haunt this house.
