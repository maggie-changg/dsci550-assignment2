Location: The Lobby Bar

Description:
Supposedly the three floors above the old bar are home to twelve different spirits or more. Very old building. Lots of history there. Upper floors were at one time hotel, then after hotel closed, used for years by passing vagrants and drifters, some of whom supposedly died up there. Very eerie up there. Looks like something right out of a horror movie.
