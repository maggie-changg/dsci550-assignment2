Location: Bonnie Castle Bed &amp; Breakfast

Description:
This renovated bed & breakfast is haunted by two ghosts. One of the ghosts is called Mary. She hates electricity. The second ghost is a ghost cat. The cat has been seen at least twice in a particular spot upstairs. A young girl once saw a man go up to the gate and asked about him. She identified the man in a picture of the original owner. Noises can be heard all through the night, but the ghosts are nice.
