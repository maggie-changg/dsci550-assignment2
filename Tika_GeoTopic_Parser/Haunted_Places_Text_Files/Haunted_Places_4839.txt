Location: Coffin rock

Description:
Campbell Cemetery - a long time ago a man was shot and killed on top of a large rock and every time it rains you can see blood running from the rock where he was killed, also in the same hollow at the Campbell cemetery a lot of ghost have been spotted there, a old man flagging down traffic, a young girl standing in the middle of the road and a older female just wandering as if she was lost, when you travel this hollow make sure to keep your windows up and doors locked its very creepy through there.
