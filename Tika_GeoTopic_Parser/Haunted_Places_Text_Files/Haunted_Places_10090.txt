Location: Lums Pond State Park

Description:
In the early 70's a runaway girl was taken into the woods and killed here. The killer was never caught but sometimes a pleading high pitched voice and muffled screams can be heard from the woods just off the Swamp Forest hiking trail which goes around Lums Pond.
