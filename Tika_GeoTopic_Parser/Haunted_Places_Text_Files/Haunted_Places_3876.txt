Location: Cemetery

Description:
when your driving through the cemetery at night, your car stalls and you hear a yelling noise from the center of the cemetery. Itâ€™s said if you see smoke from the center of the cemetery after the yelling/screaming noises, you will see your own gravestone on the way out.
