Location: Des Moines International Airport

Description:
The Cloud Room - In offices that were originally a restaurant named the Cloud Room during the 60's and 70's. Supposedly haunted by a deceased young flight attendant who materializes usually in the Autumn walking empty halls with a bag as if confused looking for her flight. The occasional noise of laughing and glasses clinking at the bar early and late when the offices are quiet. Many cold spots and unexplained noises in and outside the Cloud Room.
