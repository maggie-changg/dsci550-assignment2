Location: University of Oregon

Description:
Stafford Hall - Outside of room 101 of the Stafford Hall (resident hall) at the University of Oregon, a young black male has been sighted several times. Most often he was seen looking into the room with a curious look or darting around corners. He has also been seen across the street from the pioneer cemetery (less than a block away from the residence hall) standing on the corner late at night. He has only been seen late at night when the campus is quiet or empty.
