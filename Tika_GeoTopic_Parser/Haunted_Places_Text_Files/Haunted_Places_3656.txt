Location: University of North Alabama Area

Description:
Guillot University Center - Before it was built, a dorm for girls stood in its place. What is now UNA used to be Florence State Teacher's College. In the early 1900's, a student at the college who lived in the dorms was said to have a secret that stressed her out so much, that she hung herself from the elevator shaft in the tower of the building. No one knew what her secret was or why she felt she had to kill herself. Later, security guards in the building would hear noises that sounded like a swaying body hanging from a rope. Now the Guillot Center stands in its place and noises are still heard on the second floor.
