Location: Ridgewood dirt road

Description:
in between the dirt road there is an old construction site and there are little workhouses, trucks, cranes, etc. The gates are locked and closed 24/7 because no one has been there in at least 30 to 35 years. Believed to be haunted by a man that died of shock when he lost his hand in an explosives accident.
