Location: Hastings Middle School

Description:
The school was built over a ancient Indian burial ground. Teachers and students have reported sightings of an Indian Chief. He has been reported as a dark shadowy figure floating down halls and moving things around inn classrooms. Many of the teachers call him Chief Turkey Feather because of turkey feathers left behind after visiting classrooms.
