Location: Art City Playhouse (previously the Villa theater)

Description:
In the downstairs men's bathroom the toilets sometimes flush by themselves. Also, from the stage you can see a light shining on the wall from the doorway that leads down there but there is no explainable source and it is not visible when actually walking by the doorway.
