Description:
"the auditorium ghost" - someone or something always tends to play "tricks" on people working on any upcoming events in the auditorium. you may have turned off all the stage lights and unplugged them and still one light might stay on. or you may have put a prop set on the stage in a certain spot and the next day it is put away in the prop room.
