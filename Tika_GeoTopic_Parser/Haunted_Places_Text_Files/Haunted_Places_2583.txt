Location: Jack in the Box

Description:
its said that back in the 60s a bunch of hippies went crazy and brutally attacked and killed the workers. Now when the store closes you can hear the hippie's music and also the workers. Then really late at night when no one is there you can hear and smell the burgers grilling. Also the bathroom door open and shuts forcefully. When you look out the window you can see an appropriation of a worker cleaning the windows. If you pass by at 4:34 am the lights go on and you can see the people who died there.
