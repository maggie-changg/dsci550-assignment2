Location: Clinton Arena

Description:
When the lights are out one can hear strange noises in the arena. Reportedly a few kids entered the arena, and a hockey puck flew at them from the stands and hit the glass. One of the kids sat in a chair where a ghost had been spotted, and the kid's head started to hurt. The other kids said that they saw a white figure on his head. Sometimes when you call the name Lucy, weird things will happen. Some of the folding chairs are often down when they should be up.
