Location: Southwest Miami High School

Description:
Auditorium -  Sometimes the TVâ€™s turn on by themselves, music can be heard, a guy and a girl whispering. Supposedly a janitor died in there, and an old drama club president while fixing lights on the catwalk died also and were never found until the next day.
