Location: Newberry cemetery

Description:
there is story about the (purple bubble). It located in the upper part of Mi, Newberry cemetery and it's on the grave of a young girl who died at about 6 yrs and 6 months of age. But when you look at the bubble which holds a picture of the child it is that of an elderly woman and supposedly it has aged through out the years much as the child would have if she had lived.
