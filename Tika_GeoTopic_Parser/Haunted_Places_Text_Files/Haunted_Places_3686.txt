Location: Dale Mansion Site

Description:
A woman supposedly killed six of her husbands here. On stormy nights, you can hear men screaming. There is a family plot where her father, the first settler of DeKalb County, is buried. Teenagers have destroyed the cemetery. Itâ€™s on private property, so no trespassing!
