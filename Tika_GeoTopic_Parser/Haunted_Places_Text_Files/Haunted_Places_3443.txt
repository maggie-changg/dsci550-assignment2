Location: St Mary's Cemetery

Description:
Witnesses walking up the path from the elevated crypt belonging to the Veteran from WWII, Korean War, and Vietnam, heading toward the tall hill. Received unpleasant feelings from the forest down the hill to the left. Upon looking off to the right, noticed a grayish white human figure about 15 feet from the road walking along side of us, going the direction we had come from. Sounds of claws tapping the path. Saw a light around waist level moving around near the top of the hill.
