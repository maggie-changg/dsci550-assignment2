Location: The Weeks House

Description:
There is a house in Brooksville that has been featured in the Tampa Tribune and the St. Petersburg Times, among others, about this house that is a family home built in the early part of the 1900s. The story goes that if you drive by late at night (before the current owners moved in) you would see a candle passing by the windows on the second floor. Doors being slammed and whispers are also very common.
