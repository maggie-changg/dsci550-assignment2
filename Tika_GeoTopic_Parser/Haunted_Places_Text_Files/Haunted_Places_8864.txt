Location: CR2122

Description:
On Magraw creek where the CR2122 road goes into a private residence by a animal cemetery, ribbons have be seen floating thru the air with Arabic writings on them and lights have sped thru the road by the little cemetery right thru cars. At the house on the end of the road a man who had just built the house and lived in one week before dying face has appeared in the back of the fireplace and been photographed by his daughter who lives there and others. This can be verified by most people that have lived in Burkeville for a number of years.
