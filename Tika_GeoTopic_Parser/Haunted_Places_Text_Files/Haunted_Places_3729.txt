Location: University of Montevallo

Description:
Has several haunts. It is said to have a tunnel running under the entire campus. They were used in the civil war, and are now used as steam chassis. The theatre department in Reynolds was a civil war hospital. There was a massacre and many of the rooms were stacked with bodies. On the forth floor of Main, (one of the girls dorms) a girl burned to death while trying to cook fudge on a Bunsen burner. They have replaced the door several times, but her image is burned in the door every time the door is replaced. There are also a lot of odd occurrences as well as several ghosts that frequent the campus of Montevallo.
