Location: Oak Grove Road â€“ a.k.a. Kali Oka Road

Description:
Formerly listed in Mobile, Satsuma - This is less than a mile from the Plantation listed above. The real road the Plantation is on is Oak Grove Road as I have been there many times. The story of Crybaby bridge is a woman killed her young child by drowning it in the creek below. It is said that you can hear the sound of a baby crying late at night.
