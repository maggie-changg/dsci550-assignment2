Location: Crybaby Bridge (east of Sooner Road)

Description:
(one mile south, down 134 past Sooner.)a woman driving with her baby in the child seat, drove off into a ditch and died. The road has since been shutdown and the bridge that used to reach it is now a dilapidated wooden bridge that is impassable by car. Supposedly, that car is still in the ditch and you can see the child seat where the baby died. Some evenings, after you cross the bridge to the old abandoned road, you can hear the baby crying. -  January 2005 Update: A Resident near this area reports, both the pond, the road and the bridge are no longer there. The bridge was on Old Bryant, a dirt road that connectioned NE 12th st and NE 4th st. The car that is mentioned on your site was an old VW bug. It did not end up there as a tragic accident, it was put there by a group of kids who stole it off private property, stripped it, then pushed it over the bridge into a creek. Odly enough, there was a small pond nearby that used to feed off the creek,and the pond was locally known as "crybaby lake". The story behind that onis at one time, a couple where in a small boat fishing with their baby whenthe boat capsized. The baby was lost in the weeds and drowned. Supposedly you could go there at night and hear the baby crying. They were torn down due to housing developments about 8 years ago. The creek is still there, it serves as drainage for that part of town.
