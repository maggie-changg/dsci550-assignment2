Location: Brooks Phelps Grove Park Bridge

Description:
Off of National on Bennett is Phelps Grove Park under the third bridge late at night you can see a woman in a wedding dress known as "Bride under the Bridge" that was killed on her wedding day. This is a bridge made out of concrete and medium to small sized rocks. At night, it was somewhat cloudy and when the moon would break through the clouds and hit the rocks, you can definitely see the shape of bride's head and veil in the rocks.
