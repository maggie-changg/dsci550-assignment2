Location: Warren Historical Building

Description:
Sometimes at night if you are standing on the sidewalk in front of the building and look up in the right hand window on the top floor you can see a shadow of a lady or a lady in a white blouse (or maybe the curtain) looking outside. - Warren County Historical Society is located in the STRUTHERS-WETMORE-SCHIMMELFENG HOUSE which was constructed between 1870 & 1873 as a wedding gift from Thomas Struthers to his daughter Anna Eliza upon her marriage to George Wetmore. It now houses the Society's offices, library, archives, period exhibit rooms and featured displays. The Historical Society Library is located on the main floor and is open to the public.
