Location: Green Acres Childrens Home

Description:
Where to begin... No one knows exactly what the cause of nature of the haunting is. A former resident claims while they stayed there during their parents divorce and custody battles alot of strange happenings took place. Keep in mind this is a childrens home. The windows are bolted shut to prevent run aways. There was a spirt of a little boy no more then 5 or 6 years old that would be seen sitting on the edge of various beds as well as running from room to room slamming doors as he left a room. The basement of the place was inhabited by another spirit one that was much darker. A young girl was on laundry detail one night and she was making her way into the basement to go and change the clothes from the washer to the dryers. But before she could make it to the laundry room she was attacked by the spirit. She was thrown from wall to wall. You could see her head being pushed into the wall and the whole time she was screaming for help. *she survived the incident with a few bumps and bruises.
