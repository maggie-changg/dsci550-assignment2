Location: Old bridge

Description:
Along a road in Independence Twp. in Beaver county, there runs a creek, which is spanned by a dilapidated iron bridge. A century and a half ago, a couple riding in a carriage were killed when their horses spooked and the carriage fell into the creek from the then wooden bridge. The course of the road has been changed, but one is still able to see the figure of the woman running beside the creek on some nights.
