Location: Bowie High School

Description:
It's rumored that a man was either killed during the building of the school or was a custodian there, and we have nicknamed him "Leonard." He lives in the catwalk in the auditorium, and has reportedly thrown small rocks onto the stage. Noises have been heard like machines going off in the shop room, and bells chiming in the catwalk. One student was spit on during a rehearsal for "Grease" in 2000. The left side of her face was wet, and no one was standing on that side of her.
