Description:
NASA Building 26 - In the early days of NASA being built in Greenbelt the need for many buildings was certain. Building 26 was planned not to shortly after many others. During the construction of building 26 many human bones were found almost in a line but also in a circle. No one is sure what came of these bones but it is said to this day that that building 26 was built over an Indian burial ground. To this day guard officers and employees late at night swear to hear the sound of drums beating and lights have been known to go off and on.
