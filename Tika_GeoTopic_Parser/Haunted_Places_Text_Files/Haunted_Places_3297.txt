Location: Old High School

Description:
The old high school is fixed up and serves a different purpose now but when it was old and un useful if you went inside it there was an underground pool and there were lockers down there if you go down and open up all the lockers then leave the room you can hear all the lockers slamming closed. Also there is a belief that a little girl was burned and killed when the building caught on fire and she always carried a little doll with her and if you went up the stairs you will always see the doll in the same spot and if you move the doll and come back it will be in the same place as before. There is also a flight of stairs in the building and if you stand there and watch them you will see a young girl with a white dress floating and black long hair floating in front of you holding her doll. And last there is strange smells in the boys bathroom of the building and there is blood spots on the wall and also blodd looks like it was dripping from the ceiling it looks like a mold spot on the ceiling but red.
