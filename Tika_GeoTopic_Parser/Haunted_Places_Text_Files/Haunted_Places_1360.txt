Description:
there people have seen a dark and eerie shadow of a elderly gentleman in a top hat just walking slowly, It has been seen many times by different people, If you look down he is known to have no legs. When passed, there is a cold and eerie feeling left in your body as though you just came out of an air-conditioned room. It is quite scary late at night and very early in the morning. He has been seen a few times over the years.
