Location: The Ice house

Description:
This is where they used to keep ice back when they didn't have fridges. People have said they have seen a man hanging from one of the hooks that they used to put ice on, they have also said lots of things about people walking around on the upstairs level of the ice house.- April 2007 Update - that building was torn down.
