Description:
Shirlydale Ave.(apartments) - At the end of Shirlydale Ave after the cul-de-sac there was a house about 50 yards up that was used as a civil war hospital it was tore down in the 80'S the house was gray 2 story with a basement and to the left was a barn with a drop door into a lower level that opened to the back. There is also an old square shaped pond or was a man made one; over to the right several graves was found by the apartments when they cleared the property. It was rumored that the spiteful union solders removed the tombstones and killed the patients in the hospital as they rested and the confederate soldiers still scream and moan. You can also see soldiers walking up through the woods where the house was to get help and sometimes you can here them talking in the woods and a harmonica playing in the distance but donâ€™t be alarmed when you see a campfire in the background.
