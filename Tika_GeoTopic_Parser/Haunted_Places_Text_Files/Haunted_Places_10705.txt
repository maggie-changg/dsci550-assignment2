Location: West End Cemetery

Description:
The Bride Of West End - on certain nights you can see the dreary form of a lady in a wedding dress sitting in the trees, standing by her grave, or roaming the fields next to the cemetery. She is said to be waiting on her star-crossed lover to come and pick her up to go to their wedding.
