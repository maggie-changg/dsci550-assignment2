Location: Old Governor's Mansion

Description:
The mansion was built in 1838 and is said to he haunted. Lights turn on and off, beds unmake themselves when no one is around, and the smells of freshly baked foods can be smelled in the kitchen when no one has cooked. The mansion is currently owned by Georgia College and State University and is located on the corner of Clarke and Hancock.
