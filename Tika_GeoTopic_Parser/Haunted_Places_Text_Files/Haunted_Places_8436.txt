Location: Spook Bridge

Description:
Right near the Quitman line, take hwy 84 W,turn left at the caution light right before you get to Quitman, and go down to the first dirt road to the left. A dead end... This is an old bridge crossing water that is no longer in use. Said to be used in Satanic rituals many years ago. You park at the dead end and walk the path to the bridge. The minute you cross the dirt path onto the old concrete bridge, you feel the fear and cold. You see images of people walking toward you and can feel them touching you. There is said to be a "line of light" that few can cross. You hear screams and voices and feel a great deal of fear. Very Scary!!
