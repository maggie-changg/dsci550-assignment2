Location: St. John Westshore Hospital

Description:
Rumors of hauntings on the second floor. Things moving unexplainably... seeing a ghostly, white, man in a hospital gown in patients with heart-related injuries. Little girl seen in patients [mostly newborns] eyes and in the mirrors in their bathrooms.
