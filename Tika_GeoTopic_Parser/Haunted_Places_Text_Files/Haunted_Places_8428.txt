Location: Temple United Methodist Church

Description:
There are at least two ladies who walk this church. Driving by at night, you can see a woman standing in the second floor window of the old nursery. She appears to be looking out the window while holding a baby. High heel shoes and laughter have been heard while no one else was there. Different lights will be turned off and on throughout the night. The sound of books hitting the hardwood floors on the second floor can be heard, as well. Several pictures have been taken and a video camera recorded heat or orbs. - We have not seen any photos as of yet. - The partitions have moved, and you can hear, very distinctly, chairs moving across the floor in the old fellowship hall.
