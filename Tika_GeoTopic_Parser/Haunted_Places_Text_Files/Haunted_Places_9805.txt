Location: Cry Baby Hollow

Description:
Located off DD hwy. just outside Crocker, if you go there between 11:50P.M. and 12:20 A.M. you will see a flash of light like a door opening and hear a baby crying and screams, then hear the mother crying for her child , all the while there are sets of evil looking red eyes in various spots around you. It was rumored that the woman was pregnant and while on a hiking trip fell into a ravine and that by time her rescuers got to her that she was already dead. Also the same location is rumored to be a gateway to hell.(WARNING: most people who go there and are brave enough to stay through the whole experience have some kind of Vehicle trouble upon trying to exit the hollow.(I.E.) flat tires mysterious claw marks on the vehicle, and even wrecks!!!)
