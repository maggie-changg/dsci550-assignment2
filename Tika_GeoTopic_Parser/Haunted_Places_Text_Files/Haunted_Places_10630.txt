Description:
the abandoned mill - near the fairgrounds -  Several years ago when children were forced to work, there was a mill that a deranged man owned. Many children died of exhaustion, and the owner put their bodies in the furnace. It is a high spiritual place, and there have been many odd happenings here, including the furnace mysteriously turning on and the sound of children crying. There is a story on this website in the hauntings section. - April 2008 Correction: Whoever submitted that to you merely used the plot from the movie "The Haunting". It has since been turned into Apratments.
