Description:
Skipworth Cemetery - It is said that this cemetery, established in the 1800's, is patrolled at night by a Civil war soldier whose body is buried there. If you see a round, white light on a moonlight night in the spring of the year and are not family or friend you must exit the cemetery at once or your entire family will be cursed.
