Location: Marie Schmidt-Bremer Mansion

Description:
Cold spots, an apparition of a woman with brown hair and wearing a long white dress, and the sound of someone climbing the stairs when there is no one around. - March 2008 update/ additional information: The Mansion which is located across from the Schmidt Brewery which Marieâ€™s father, Jacob, started. Her husband Adolph Bremer took over the brewery after Jacob's death. Still researching the haunting aspect - but the location is currently a halfway house for men in recovery.
