A boy committed suicide in the drama room and if you are alone there in the room you can hear a boys voice even though nobody is there it is in the backstage area of the stage you can hear him talk as if he is reciting something and than just stop a lot how James died he was reciting a monologue and shot himself. Also if you do not leave him a seat on opening night to each place in the auditorium it has been known for plays to go bad very quickly so the theatre crews always leave him a front row seat empty
