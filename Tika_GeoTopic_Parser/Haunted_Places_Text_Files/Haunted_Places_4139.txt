Location: Miami University

Description:
Peabody Hall - This hall has been known to have many sightings along with the sighting of a Ms. Helen Peabody. There have been sightings mainly in just individual rooms in the dorm. There has been documentation of a girl hanging herself in room 210, and then another person hanging themselves in that same room years later. In other rooms, there have been times where the window shades of only a couple of rooms would flap frantically, but there's now evidence of any wind and no person standing by the windows.
