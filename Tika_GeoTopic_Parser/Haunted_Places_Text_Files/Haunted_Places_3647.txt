Location: Gainswood Plantation

Description:
The ghost of Evelyn Carter haunts this house as well as other ghosts. Ms. Carter was the sister of a housekeeper in the late 1800's. Also, the smell of a man named Colonel Gaines' pipe is hinted near his study and the rush of skirts is heard going down the main stairs from the birthing room. Some have felt an occasional push.
