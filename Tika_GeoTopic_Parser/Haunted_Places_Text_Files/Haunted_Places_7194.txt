no matter what time of day you go there there is a fog that’s sits at the top of the hill no breeze, no birds, or insects. If you go there he is not buried where its mark you have to walk 1.5 miles back you’ll know when you get there because its like a cold pocket.Urban legend Stories say on some cold fall nights you can see Hookman walking old lovers lane looking for his next victim.
