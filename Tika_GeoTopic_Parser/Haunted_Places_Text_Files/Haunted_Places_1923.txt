Location: Riverside Bridge

Description:
Supposedly, the now dry riverbed used to house a green "monster." This "monster" was reportedly seen on one occasion when it came up on the bridge and attacked the passenger of a car. Green residue was the only evidence left behind on this meet-and-greet with civilization.
