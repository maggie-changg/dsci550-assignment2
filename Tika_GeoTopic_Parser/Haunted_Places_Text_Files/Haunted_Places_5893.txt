Location: Tottenville

Description:
The woods at the end of Hylan Blvd, on Satterlee, were once an old Indian burial ground. If the trails are followed properly, you will come across an in-ground well, or DUMPING AREA, but be careful, DON'T GET TOO CLOSE! It is said that there are still spirits wandering around what is also now a car graveyard.
