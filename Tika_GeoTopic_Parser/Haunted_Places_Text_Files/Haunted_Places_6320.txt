Location: Mingo

Description:
Mingo Cemetery - about 8 years ago 2 witnesses were in the cemetery and very busy recording the graves and felt like somebody was watching them. They finished and started to have a conversation saying, "I thought I saw and heard kids playing in the cemetery". And said she thought she seen them dressed in old-fashioned clothing, 1800s. They tried some of the locals about this area and nobody wants to talk about it.
