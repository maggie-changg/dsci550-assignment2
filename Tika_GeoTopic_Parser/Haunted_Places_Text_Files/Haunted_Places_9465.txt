Location: January 2007 Update/ Additional Information: Everyone has to clear out of the place by 1am. Police do patrol the place often. Many people [a LOT] have been hurt falling off the wall, tripping over graves, breaking arms

Description:
that kind of thing. There is very little to no cell phone service out there. Officers take minors back to the Tom Thumb and/or GrovinNovins and call there folks, wait for them to arrive to pick them up and go get the other vehicle back at the cemetery. There are homes in this area. Be respectful on how loud you are driving the road.
