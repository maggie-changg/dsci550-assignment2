Location: Lanterman Developmental Center

Description:
The acute building at the developmental center is thought to be the place with the most hauntings and activity, with a morgue in the basement for clients that pass. All through out the center, doors suddenly lock and unlock themselves. Keys spin around in the locks. Footsteps and voices can be heard on the residences. Figures can be seen going down the halls, washing there hands, or just playing with staff.
