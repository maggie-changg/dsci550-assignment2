Location: Tai Tung Village (Mural)

Description:
On special nights, especially during nights when it is uncommonly calm and quiet, you can feel a cold aura when you stare at the mural. If you stare at the right corner long enough, you could see something emerging from the painting in the form of a small child or a short man.
