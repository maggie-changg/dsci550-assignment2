Location: Dunwoody

Description:
Brook Run -  in the back of the park is a gated off area, when inside go down the road and go in the building on the right. There is a huge abandoned building that was a home for the mentally challenged. There are various areas with temperature changes, an extremely strange aura to the place, and pictures will reveal orbs. cold spots on first and second floor, footsteps heard, doors open and close, and banging sounds on the walls. The most haunted is the 3rd floor it many believe a little boy hunts it. - March 2008 update Has been torn down
