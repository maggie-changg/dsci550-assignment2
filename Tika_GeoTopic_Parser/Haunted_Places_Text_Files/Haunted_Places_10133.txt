Location: Post Office

Description:
Lately people been seeing strange figures in the windows. One time someone went to the post office at night and was checking their mail when they happened to look into the window, and in the reflection of the window they saw someone standing behind them just staring at them. By the time they turned around to look and see who it was, it was gone. They got really frightened and tried to leave but the door was locked. They tried everything to get out but nothing worked so they had to stay in there until the next morning. Now that person is in the hospital, tramatized.
