Location: Highland Lawn Cemetery

Description:
Just the old story of Stiffy Green. Supposedly Stiffy (a dog) and his dead master can be seen walking in the cemetery at night. February 2005 Update/Correction: Stiffy Green did not roam the cemetary, but instead was inside the mausoleum of his owner. He was removed several years ago because the cemetary didn't want kids driving through the cemetary late at night.
