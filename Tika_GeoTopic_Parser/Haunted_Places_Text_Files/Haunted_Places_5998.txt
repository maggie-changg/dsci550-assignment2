Description:
Catholic Chapel - Another Officer was up one night in the Catholic Chapel playing around with the electronic organ. After he was done playing, he turned the organ off. All of a sudden, as he was leaving, the organ began to play ferociously - and then quit out. He got out of the Catholic Chapel.
