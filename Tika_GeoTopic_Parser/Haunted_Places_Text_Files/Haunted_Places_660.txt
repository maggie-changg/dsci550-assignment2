Location: Watts Township

Description:
Amity Hall Hotel - Amity Hall - There was a young woman found stabbed to death laying on the front porch on a couch. The legend has it that there was a family that lived in it and the husband went crazy and killed his wife, then his kids, then himself in the upstairs hallways/rooms of the hotel. IN the days of the PA Canal system, canal travelers used to stay there, then in the civil war days it was used as a hospital. - IF planning to visit this place – try to get permission - it says no trespassing When you get permission bring plenty of batteries, because they drain quickly. In the corner of the L-shaped building, very small bluish lights have been. The creepier place on the outside is a door at the end of a hall which is locked shut. The worst room in the house is upstairs, the trophy room. This room is filled with a giant feeling of "GET OUT OF HERE". The glass and mirrors are all broken. Very faint white figure of what appears to be a woman in the attic window facing the parking lot can be seen. white flashes of light in the attic windows facing the road have been seen. Faint glows fading in and out of the windows, as well as small but somewhat bright points of light coming from the corner of the L-shape. Frightening black figures, not the shape of a dog, but about the size of a dog, linger in the parking lot. (I believe they are called imps) A particularly vengeful spirit has sat outside of cars in which males are present. It’s believed it is the wife whom the husband beat to death and left on the front porch. It is also said that you can experience reenactments of the murder right in front of you.
