Location: Train Station

Description:
Apparently, a in the old days, 2 trains somehow caught the same track and collided head first into one another and killed all the passengers. It is said now that the trains can still be heard late at night and the whistle blows right before the apparent collision takes place. This can be found in some of the Carolina Ghost storybooks.
