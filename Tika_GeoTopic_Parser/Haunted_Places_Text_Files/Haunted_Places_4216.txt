Description:
on Collingwood Ave. has several ghosts inhabiting its rooms, stairways, attic, and auditorium. It used to be a dormitory for nuns and has several nuns that don't seem to want to leave; including one in the auditorium that walks down the aisle way from the balcony to a certain seat in the theater, sits down and is visible for a few seconds and the vanishes. She has a very negative, angry vibe about her and is not pleasant to witness. There is also a much nicer spirit in the attic who seems to be sewing when seen, who is a nun also. The west hall way in the apartment building has the spirit of a bride who was left at the alter and later killed herself. there is a male entity in one of the rooms and another in the basement.
