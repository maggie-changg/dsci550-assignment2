Location: Toltec Mounds

Description:
About twenty minutes from Little Rock, this is an old prehistoric Native American worship site. Many consider it Arkansas' "Stonehenge." Large dirt mounds were used as a calendar to predict the future, and for magical purposes. Apparitions are seen, and strange noises have been heard. The site is about 100 acres.
