Location: Gila Reservation (The Deep South of Leveen)

Description:
Going into the southwest of Leveen, where the Indians live, you'll see a street called The Boonies. If you go to that street, it starts to get cold. Then, as you drive down this street for a while youâ€™ll cross some bridges, which lead you to some old buildings. There are reports of a being or a demon that resembles a Centaur in this area.
