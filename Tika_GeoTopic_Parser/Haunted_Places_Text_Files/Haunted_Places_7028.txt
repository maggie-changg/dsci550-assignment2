Location: Posey chapel (near)

Description:
A century and a half ago a church was burnt down and the preacher hung himself from a tree as you enter the gate. At night you can see the activity under the pavilion that is where the chapel once stood. Red eyes can be seen and a red light of some sort can be seen moving through the woods.
