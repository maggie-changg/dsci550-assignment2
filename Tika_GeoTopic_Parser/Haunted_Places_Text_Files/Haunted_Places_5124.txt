Description:
Old Miners Memorial Hospital and ARH Regional Hospital - Built in the 1950's this hospital has seen many deaths from the people of eastern KY being the only hospital for almost 5 counties around it for many years. Abandoned in 1987 and turned into an office building and part of the University of Kentucky, the spirits inside still do not rest. Sightings include someone calling your name in the hallways, to no answer of course, a strange black form that can knock you down in the old mental ward. Many a security guard has quit because of this building.
