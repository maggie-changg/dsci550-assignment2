Location: Sam Levitz Furniture Store on 36th Street

Description:
A long time ago, a man was up on one of the racks and tragically fell off. He fell many feet below, and did not survive the fall. Witnesses have seen the man wearing a black shirt and black hat, thinking he’s still working. They've also had a psychic come into the building and try to make him go away, but the man will not leave. He’s seen between 4AM and 5AM.
