Location: Abandoned Sewage Plant

Description:
Went there a few times as a kid...abandoned in a hurry, books, TV, cloths etc were left in the watchman's house. Underground Tunnels. A lot of dead animals and skeletons around it and inside of it. Located in Jadwin Village, down the road that says do not enter, if you go along the sides you can get under the fence in a few areas...the MPs sometimes go down there if someone calls them....Strange feeling when you look at the tunnel...or get close to it.
