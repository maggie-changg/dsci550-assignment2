Location: Haunted Creek

Description:
Behind Fairfield Bowling Lanes â€“ The creek is haunted by a mother and her child. The woman looks as if she is in her mid- twenties and the child is around three or four. She wears a long, white dress probably from around the early 1800's or late 1700's. The little boy wears brown pants, a white shirt and a cap. It is believed that a woman and child were most brutally killed, in a mass murder spree.
