Location: Hot Lake hotel

Description:
It was a resort built in 1907 considered the "mayo clinic of the west" because of the hot springs, it burned down in 1934 all except the brick portion, after that it was used as a hotel and then an insane asylum and finally a nursing home in the 1970's. Reports of a piano playing when there isn't a piano in the building, and clattering footsteps roaming the halls. many people have ventured in to this hotel which was once a hospital many people have said that a gardener once hung himself behind the hotel and say that to this day he haunts the grounds there have been many reports oh chairs falling of the walls and doors opening and closing them when no one is around - December 2003 correction: The piano that is said to be heard is believed to be the original piano that was acquired when the hotel was built. It belonged to General Robert E. Lee's wife, and was said to be haunted and played by itself even before it was given to hot lake. The piano was removed by a former owner who later killed himself, but the music remained. Also, there is a gazebo just outside at the side of one of the lakes, and there have been reports of ghosts walking along the water and voices in the gazebo. Also, many strange happenings year around on the highway that passes hot lake. Many accidents have totaled cars with none hurt, and figures seen in the thick soupy fog that sometimes drapes the highway. The ghosts of the hotel are said to be the souls of many who died as a result of experiments performed when the hotel was an insane asylum.
