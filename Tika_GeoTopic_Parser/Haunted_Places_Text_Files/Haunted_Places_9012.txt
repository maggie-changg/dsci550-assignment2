Location: Del Frisco's Steakhouse

Description:
In the 1800's, this area of Ft. Worth was known as "Hell's Half Acre" because of its numerous saloons, brothels and gambling halls. Used to be a bathhouse in the 1800s where a man was shot in the head. His spirit roams the banquet halls and the upstairs bar.
