Location: Shoefelt Rd

Description:
They say that if you go to the end of Shoefelt road at about midnight on Friday nights you will here an old hunter shooting his gun off, because the old man used to hunt out there a lot and then he died and he doesn't like it when people hunt or have fun on his hunting spot so he will scare you off by shooting his gun and than walking around by your car hollering.
