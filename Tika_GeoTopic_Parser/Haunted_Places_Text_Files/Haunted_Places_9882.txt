Location: Forrest Hill Cemetery

Description:
There is a mausoleum on the mid south end of the cemetery and if you go there towards the beginning of sunset, you can sometimes hear rock-n-roll music coming from the inside. And you get a very uneasy feeling when you get close to it.**If you decide to visit this or any other cemetery, make sure you have respect for the families and the ones resting there. Vandals give true paranormal seekers a bad name.
