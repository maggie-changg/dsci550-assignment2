Location: Webster Elementary

Description:
many ghost hunters have been there and seen the ghost on camcorders; they go in classrooms and hear kids laughing, screaming and crying.Â  This school is abandoned now.- September 2004 update: The school was recently burned down (police suspect vandalism) and was subsequently torn down by demolision crews.
