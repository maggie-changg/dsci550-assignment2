Location: McCorristin Catholic High School

Description:
Lockers that have been locked are found open, the scorer's buzzer in the gymnasium buzzes for no reason, lights go out by themselves even in good weather, and on one occasion a stack of papers was blown off a desk when there were no windows open or fans on.
