Location: Cal Hill Rd

Description:
Down towards the lower part of Cal Hill just as you round the corner before the church a black object will chase you, sometimes as far as the church, sometimes even farther. There used to be an old house there and if you went in you could see a soldier's jacket hanging on the back of a chair and blood in one of the jacket's pockets.
