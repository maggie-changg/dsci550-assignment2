Location: Seneca Caverns

Description:
Tour guides and tourists have reported seeing small balls of light bounce along the floor and walls of the caverns. If the balls are approached, they move away. Also, a "ghost tour" sometimes follows unsuspecting individuals through the cave. Other strange things, such as doors slamming as tours approach, and lights flickering off and on are regular happenings.
