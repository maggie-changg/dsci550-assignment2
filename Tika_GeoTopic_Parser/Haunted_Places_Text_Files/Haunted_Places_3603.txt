Location: The Victoria

Description:
The Victoria was once a beautiful mansion. It's been adapted into a restaurant/hotel. Reports of the piano being played and footsteps in the main part of the building have scared more than a few visitors. Sometimes the glasses hanging in the bar clink, and a woman has been spotted on the upstairs landing.
