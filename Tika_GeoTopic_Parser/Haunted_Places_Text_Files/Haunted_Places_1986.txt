Location: El Campo Santo Cemetery

Description:
Formerly posted as "Old Town Cemetery" - This was partially paved over with a road. It is said ghosts appear to be crossing that section of the road at night. - February 2004 Correction: The proper name of the "Old Town Cemetery" in San Diego is "El Campo Santo Cemetery." Among the numerous other spirits sighted at the location (including the paved portions under the adjacent sidewalk and streets), psychics claim that the site is to this day overseen by the spirit of the gravedigger whose own grave is near the cemetery's SE corner.
