Location: Cry Baby Bridge

Description:
Story says that a bus full of little kids ran off the bridge and they all died. Rumors are, if you go there, turn your lights off, and put your car in neutral; something will push you across to safety. After you are pushed across get out and put powder on your windows and you can see little baby hand prints.
