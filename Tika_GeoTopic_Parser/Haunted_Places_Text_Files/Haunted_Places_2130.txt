Location: American Greetings

Description:
Several workers have seen people or images walking past them inside the factory. One janitor saw a little boy dressed as an Indian standing at the bottom of the stairs. Then, he vanished. One power truck driver screamed one night, because she said a little boy was staring her in the face when she turned around, and then he just disappeared.
