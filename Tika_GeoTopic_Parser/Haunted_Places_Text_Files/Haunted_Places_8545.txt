Location: Just off highway 69 in-between Emory and Lone Oak

Description:
there is an old graveyard where a witch was hung and burned. If you go to the very far back right of the cemetery around 1 to 2:30 a.m. and stand with your back to the tree, usually up on the hill you will see a dark apparition of a man in a suit. Witnesses also report hearing footsteps all around them.
