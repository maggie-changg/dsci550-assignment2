Location: Catalina High School

Description:
Students have reported that during school events, the bathroom stalls would lock by themselves, and many times the bathrooms were closed off because of unexplainable floods. Rumor has it that a man died from a heart attack in the school, and that it might be him that is creating this havoc.
