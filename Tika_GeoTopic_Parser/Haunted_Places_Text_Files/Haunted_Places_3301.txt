Location: Thomas-Foreman Historical Home

Description:
Old home built in 1898 Indian Territory. Mrs. Foreman died in the home in 1968 and it was later made into a museum. Her caretaker (Presley) continued his chores at the home until his death in 1989. He would tell stories of how he could look up while doing yard work and see Mrs. Foreman standing in the doorway watching him. House has many cold spots and an overall uneasy feeling. It is located at 1419 W. Okmulgee Ave and has just been re-opened for tours.
