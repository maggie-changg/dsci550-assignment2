Description:
This is the legendary story of the lady in white who jumped off the tower in the early 1900's.  It has been said and seen that a woman wearing a white dress with a rose in her mouth stands and guards the water tower.  She has been known to come out only at 12:00 midnight to show off her lovely white dress and to dance around the tower.
