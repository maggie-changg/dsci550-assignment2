Location: Santee Tribal Office

Description:
A little boy has been seen and heard walking the hallways of the tribal building. Last year a photograph was taken in the Head Start office and a child's face of a boy was transparent over the face of the child coloring. No other children were in the room besides the child coloring. The boy appeared to have a bruised up face and his eyes seemed to be bloated.
