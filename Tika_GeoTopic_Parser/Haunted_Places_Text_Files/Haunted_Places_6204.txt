Location: Riverside Cemetery

Description:
Apparently when driving by the Riverside cemetery it's been said on certain nights and will start seeing eyes vaguely glowing, this turns into a crowd of eyes, most likely the residents of the cemetery. Seeing the number of sets of eyes staring shows the significance of how many apparitions are there.
