Location: Birchwood Saloon

Description:
A young man was shoveling snow from the roof of an adjacent building, when his shovel contacted a power line, electrocuting him. Bartenders and patrons have since heard voices, and a juke box playing on its own. They have seen apparitions, items being moved, etc. They believe the spirit of the deceased man continues to inhabit the place.
