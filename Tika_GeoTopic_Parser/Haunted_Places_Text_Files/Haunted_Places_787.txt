Description:
Briar 2 - On the bottom floor in the far rooms there was repeating occurrences of a ghost. Printers would start printing pictures of girls in the house, faucets would mysteriously turn on, and one girl heard a man talking while she was sleeping when there was nobody around. Strange white circles are said to have showed up in pictures as well.
