Description:
Allegheny Center, Building #7 - It has a documented high turnover for students living there, which some say is due to a "bad vibe" the building gives off. It had several incidents of strange phenomenon ranging from cold spots, knocking/rapping, poltergeist like activity, and even visual sightings. The energy's also seem to not be concentrated in just one place, and move freely around the building. Wide majorities of people have reported experiences while living there. A student radio show around Halloween did a segment about the building, and it had several call-ins about strange occurrences at "Agony #7" (a student nickname given to the building). Many skeptics blame the activity on student recreational drug use, pranks, and people blowing easily explained occurrences out of proportion. But many skeptics have become believers.
