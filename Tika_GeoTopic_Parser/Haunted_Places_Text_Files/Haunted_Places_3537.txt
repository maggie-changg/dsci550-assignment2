Location: Jackson Street

Description:
Every year at about the same time during the first week of the third month you can feel the souls of fallen gangsters enter your body. Only if you find yourself walking down the street between seven forty-five and twelve o-clock midnight. You may even see a bloodstain vanish into the ground.
