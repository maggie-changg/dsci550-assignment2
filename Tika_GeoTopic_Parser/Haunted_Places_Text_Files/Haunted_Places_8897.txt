Location: Huntsman Chemical Plant

Description:
Witnesses have heard doors slamming and opening, voices, and apparition of a tall pale man, and also footsteps. They always get a strong feeling that they're being followed or watched as they patrol through the company's training building, which was used as a makeshift hospital during a plant emergency about 4 years ago where 2 people lost their lives in an explosion.
