Location: Kings Courts

Description:
where the old pizza hut used to be. Near highway 31,and if you take that road all the way back till you see a trailer court you found it! There have been seen strange creatures and very strange noises back there. Thereâ€™s a cemetery on the side dating back to the 1800s and there been dry lighting hitting it for some time now (worth a look).
