Location: Bake Oven Knob

Description:
Located on the Kittatinny Ridge at the border between Lehigh and Carbon county, Bake Oven Knob is a rocky outcrop on the mountain. According to many sources there are odd occurrences in the forest. Noises and whispers are a common thing, and are rumored to be the spirit of a hiker who fell off the rocks. At some points people have even reported the forest getting extremely dark even just a few feet in while it is still light out.
