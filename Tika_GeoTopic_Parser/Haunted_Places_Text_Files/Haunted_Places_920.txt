Description:
St. Patrick's Cemetery - my investigation took place at dusk in the summer of 2003. when entering this cemetery an immediate overwhelming urgency to leave feeling comes upon you. Cold spots, and feeling extremely uncomfortable. This cemetery has graves that date back in the 1800's to recent. It sits on a hill with the back end of it encased by woods. the further into the cemetery we would go the more uncomfortable it became. In some areas you may feel very short of breath or a heaviness in your chest. A local group of investigators claim they got EVPs with a child playing “peek-a-boo” and evil growling noises.
