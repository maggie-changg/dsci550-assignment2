Description:
old TB sanitarium - Laural BuildingThe Sequoia Dawn low income housing that is there now was once an old TB sanitarium and hospital for Tulare County. Several of the residents have had strange occurrences in their apartments and also other buildings there. There is a room in the clinic there that is so cold you feel uncomfortable in it and that room is only used for storage now. Also voices are heard throughout the buildings by residents and when they turn to look no one is there. A woman who lived upstairs in the Laural building saw an apparition of a woman in her hallway that suddenly vanished.
