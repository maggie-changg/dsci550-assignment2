Location: St. Joesph's Catholic Church

Description:
It has been said that before the church was built, it was a Catholic school.  The current office was built where one of the nun's office was. People have described that they see her often around the church. She has been said to be the cause of calls to the Lino police in places where there are no phones (such as the religious classrooms).  The people who work in the office have experienced doors opening and slamming shut, and the piano player has witnessed the keyboard being played & no one was sitting on the bench. Another witness said that she was sitting at her desk and a bible fell off the shelf. After putting it back up, a few minutes later it fell back down. This when on for a while. One of the teens in the church has said to have heard heels walking behind her and there was no one there. Then she heard someone whisper "Stop That!" No one was there.
