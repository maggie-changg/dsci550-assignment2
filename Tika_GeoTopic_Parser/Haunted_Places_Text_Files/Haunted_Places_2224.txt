Description:
Many stories have been told of a strange dark hooded "ghost" that carries a lantern and wonders through this cemetery vanishing into thin air when approached. Many other stories of strange lights, sounds and visions of fire leaping from the crypts. A greenish fog is often seen floating through the area and has said to have broken windows of cars that pass through it. Some have said that the "hauntings" are a result of the Oregon Vortex, which is, located close by.
