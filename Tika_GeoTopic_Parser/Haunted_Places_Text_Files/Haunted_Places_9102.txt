Location: Valley Oaks Elementary School

Description:
A former worker reports always felt an eerie presence in the girls bathroom, many kids told the workers that the school used to be a cemetery a long time ago, they used just took out the engraved cements. There's a legend that a girl died in the merry-go-round a long time ago, decapitated, on the bottom of the merry-go-round. (they don't have that merry-go-round anymore. My sister said that when she was in the girls room, she heard a toilet flush by itself!! many report that when they turned off the bathroom lights, and chanted "La Llorona" (bloody mary) 40 times, she would appear, my sister and many students were witnesses of seeing a girl praying to Satan, to a tree, and then rolling her eyes 'till they were white.
