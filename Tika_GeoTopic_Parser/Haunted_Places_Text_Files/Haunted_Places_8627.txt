Location: Adobe Horseshoe Restaurant / Dinner Theater

Description:
There have been sightings of a lady wearing a yellow hat in the restaurant by people that are unaware of haunting. San Elizario was once the County seat. This woman is well-dressed in a long dress wearing a yellow hat. Since hat wearing is uncommon in this area, customers inquire about the odd woman. They are amazed to find they have just seen a ghost.
