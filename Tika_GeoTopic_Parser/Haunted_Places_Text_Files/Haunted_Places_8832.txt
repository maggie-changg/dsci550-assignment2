Location: Wal-Mart

Description:
There have been two separate sightings a night time manager was walking by a toy agile and saw a woman with a Wal-Mart smock on but no one was supposed to be in the area so she stopped and went back to the aisle and the woman was no where to be found. On a different occasion a night associate was in the receiving area and turned to find a little boy, she heard a noise and turned her head away for a moment and turned it back and the boy was gone.
