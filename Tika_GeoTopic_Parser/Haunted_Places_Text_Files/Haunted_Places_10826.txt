Description:
Woodglenn Park - In the late 80's, early 90's at the back side of Woodglenn Park there was a playground and a men’s and women’s bathroom building. Some teenagers one day were playing a prank on a young man and locked him in the bathroom so he could not get out the building caught on fire and the young man was killed. Some say it was a prank gone badly and some say it was murder. If you are walking down that sidewalk late at night you can here screams and also something in the large Cottonwood Trees that still stand above where the bathroom used to be. Now there is a new playground there but the spirit still remains. It is said that after you have heard these noises that you feel like someone is chasing you, like the boy wants to chase you down. May 2008 Correction: The building is still there. It is no longer being used as a bathroom, even though there is faded print on one of the doors that says women’s. The doors are locked and there are two port-a-potties on the side to replace the bathrooms. Also there are two trees really close to the building. One of the trees has no bark on the side of the trunk that is facing the building (likely from the fire). Oh and one more thing. Something really similar happened about 7 years ago at the same building.
