Location: Old Caryville Church and School House

Description:
About thirty years ago, investors were going to tear down this old church and build a new one. The priest got rather upset over the notion and hanged himself in the bell tower. Since his death, many creepy things have happened. There was also was a little boy that went to school there and mysteriously died. If you sit at the desk that he died in, you will feel a really weird rush as if something is passing through your body.
