Description:
This park was once a Civil War prison camp named Camp Lincoln. The lighthouse, which is no longer in use, is said to be haunted. There are also stories of a woman who hunts for a grave. She has been known to ask passerbyâ€™s to help her find it. There is even a general who haunts the campground. In the fort proper, people have reported seeing figures on the walkway surrounding it, and hearing faint voices.
