Location: Hernando Heritage Museum

Description:
Many things have happened in this house, including hearing a child cry when no child was around, and seeing orbs and mists on digital cameras.Â  Lights have also been seen at night when it is closed and people on tours have felt cold drafts pass by their bodies.
