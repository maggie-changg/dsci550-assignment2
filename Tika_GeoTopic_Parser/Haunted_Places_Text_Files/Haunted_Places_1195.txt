Location: Prichard Hollow Road

Description:
Moaning, crying, and semi-quiet screaming can be heard on the Plant's parking lot and nearby houses yard. Things looking like 3-Dimensional shadows, (Nicknamed "Shades"), have been seen running through the parking lot, down the road, and hiding behind trees. Eerie feelings of being watched, somehow sensing a dog nearby, and even low growls can be heard day or night. Only seems to happen around 11:00 pm on cool nights.
