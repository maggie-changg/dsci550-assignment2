Description:
Turn Hall is located on Turners Avenue in Adams, Massachusetts. Downstairs, there is a gym, bar, and bowling alley for members and residents of the Adams area. Upstairs, there is an appartment, that is occupied. Two friends were reported to have been looking out a bedroom window into the gym and seeing unusual things. There are a few people associated with Turn Hall that were members that have passed away that have also been reported to have been seen dowstairs in the bar room. There was a coach for gymnastics that commited suicide a few years ago that has been known to answer people's calls and still be wathing over her workplace. All these spirits aren't out to scare, though, they are all nice.
