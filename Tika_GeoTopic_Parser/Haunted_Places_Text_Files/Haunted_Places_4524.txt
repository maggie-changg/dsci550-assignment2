Location: OLD GOVERNMENT JAIL

Description:
There is an old white building the government now uses as a storage area for facility management, when you walk by this building at night you can see someone looking at you out the barred windows. I was told by my grandmother is once was a jail in the early 1900's. My friends and I were walking around one night and seen it for our self, shadows and profile outlines of people like things looking out at us, I never realized I could run so fast.
