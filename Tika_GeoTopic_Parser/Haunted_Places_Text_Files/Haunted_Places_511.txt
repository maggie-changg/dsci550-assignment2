Location: Our Lady of Refuge Parish

Description:
An old man, believed to be in his 90's appears in the basement boiler room just above the man boiler. He has no body, just a head. If you rattle the keys near the door you stand a good chance of spotting him. Most think that he was once the school's/church's janitor.
