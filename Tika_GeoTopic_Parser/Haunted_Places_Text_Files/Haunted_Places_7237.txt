Location: Pleasanthill's Cemetery

Description:
At night, if you go all the way back to the small creek, you here bells, and the sound of a gate opening and closing. There is a spirit there that haunts the cemetery more than others. The name of the spirit is Ahab Gullet. His tombstone reads: "Friends beware as you pass by, as you are now so once was I. As I am you soon shall be, prepare for death and follow me." If you read this aloud, spirits will appear before you.
