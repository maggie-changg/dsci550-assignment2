People report seeing him walking the halls, or just being a mischief and messing with things, or people feeling like they are being followed. One worker reports they were one of the last people he spoke to and hugged before he passed.. And since then, they think he has been "following" and playing paranks them. The worker and the man very good friends. and The worker that passed was everyone's fix-it guy. The last thing he fixed Was an ice maker. He now like to mess with the ice maker to let the workers no he is around. Others have reported being touched as well.
