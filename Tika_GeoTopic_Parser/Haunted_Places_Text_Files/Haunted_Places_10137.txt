Location: Little Oak Road

Description:
People driving on the road late at night claim to see a man about 6 foot high dancing on the road and jumping really high into the air. They say that when they get close to the spirit it looks at them and it has red eyes then vanishes. There are also other ghosts that haunt the road. A section of the road was built over a cemetery henceforth the ghosts.
