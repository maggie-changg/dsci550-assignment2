Description:
In the early 1900's Three out of work miners from the small Mining town of Hastings head about a widow who had a large amount of jewelry and money and thought it to be an easy score. The made there way to the widows house and made way with the money after one of the robbers was shot in the arm by the widows oldest son. They made there way to what was at the time Miller Run Mining Company No.1 the hit the loot in a non-operating part of the mine and returned to Hastings. They were picked up in a police dragnet three days later after getting drunk and bragging about what they did. Not enough evidence was ever brought up to convict them when they were released they made there way back to the mine to recover the loot and make a get away. While they were digging they caused a large cave in that flooded nearly all of Miller Run the other side of the mountain was opened up into Chest Creek Mining Company where it meets with the old Miller Run min shaft. Fire Bosses and Pumpers working late at night would report digging and screaming noises coming from back Old Miller Run and still to this day if the mine is quite enough you can still hear the bone quenching noises of the 3 robbers desperately trying to get there money. The money and the bodies where never recovered due to the mine becoming flooded. Chest Creek Mining Co. is now Seldom Seen Mining co. is it for touring only and they are give from Memorial day till Labor day during the Halloween Season there is a haunted mine Conducted
