Description:
Mason Hall - there have been sightings of an old man in the oak room in the basement.  Supposedly he was locked in there in 1975 and suffocated and died.  the toilets flush themselves.  Voices have been heard in halls.  There is a loud banging noise that can be heard early in the morning.  Sometimes the lights will flicker and an eerie presence can be felt in the laundry room.
