Location: the Mirage

Description:
Rumors that the Bath Rooms by Danny Gans' theatre are haunted. The automatic sensor faucets go on by themselves when in there late and alone. 1 cleaning lady won't go in there and holds her rosary beads as she passes the area after witnessing the sinks while cleaning it. There are rumors a wall fell down on workers when the casino was being built.
