Description:
Tuckaway Dormitory - Tuckaway was an inn prior to being a dormitory. The ghost there is supposedly that of a hunter who stayed at the inn and was killed in a hunting accident. He appears to the last student to go to bed in Tuckaway each night. Since so many students there literally stay up all night for various reasons, there are few nights where someone is the last to go to bed. Reports of the victim feeling hands grab his throat and start to choke him.
