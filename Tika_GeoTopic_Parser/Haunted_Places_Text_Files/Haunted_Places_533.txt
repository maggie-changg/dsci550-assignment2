Location: North Park

Description:
Old Mill Rd. - Gravity Hill - At the stop sign closest to North Park Golf Course, you are on a hill going down...but when you stop at the stop sign and put your car in neutral, you actually go back up the hill instead of drifting down the hill! I haven't heard of any reasons why this happens.
