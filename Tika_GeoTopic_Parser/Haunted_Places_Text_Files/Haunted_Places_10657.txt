Location: Prince Frederick's Church/Graveyard

Description:
Formerly listed in Murrells Inlet â€“ Old Gunn Church/Graveyard -  An old church built as a parish in the 1700's. Now burned down but front of church still remains. Old graveyard has confederate soldiers graves. Believed to be haunted by a priest that fell off the roof. The Old Gunn church (accurate name is Prince Frederick's Church) ruins are not in Murrells Inlet, SC but is located on highway SC22-4 off US 701 about 16 miles north of Georgetown, SC. The book "Ghosts of Georgetown" gives a good accounting of the events of this church and its history but there are variations of the story. One version: During the building of the church Mr. Gunn (who was either an architect or Overseer of the slaves) was in the bell tower. It is believed he was an Overseer because when he fell he was not dead and the slaves refused to approach or help him. They feared him so much for his evil ways they ran away and left him to die alone, cursing them. The church was finally finished but had a tragic history and was finally abandoned. They say he haunts the area. Witnesses report the air is very heavy and thick though the ruins are in the open with pine trees around the area. They have fenced it off now so it is difficult to get inside and what remains of the church is dangerous to be around. Make sure you are not trespassing when you visit.
