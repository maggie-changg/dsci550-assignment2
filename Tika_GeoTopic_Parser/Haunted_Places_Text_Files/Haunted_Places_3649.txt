Location: Fort Crawford Cemetery/Park

Description:
If you go in the cemetery at night at around 11:00PM - 12:00PM, you can sometimes hear children laughing and see a shadowy black figure roaming the cemetery. In the park, from around midnight to 3AM, you can see a confederate solider walking around. If you stay long enough, he will ask you if you have seen his gun.
