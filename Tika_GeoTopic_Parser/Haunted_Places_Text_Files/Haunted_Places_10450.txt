Location: Chanhassen Dinner Theater

Description:
This theater was built over the site of a house that burnt down with a woman still inside. She is said to haunt the new structure. There is another ghost here of an actor who was hit by a car when she was bicycling home from work. Her spirit has been spotted backstage. - March 2008 update: According to Chanhassen Dinner Theatre AND the Carver County Historical Society - there isn't now and never was a haunting.
