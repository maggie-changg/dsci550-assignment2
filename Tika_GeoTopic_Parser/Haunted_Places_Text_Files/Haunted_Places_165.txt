Description:
O'Leary Auditorium -  There's a patch in the ceiling where a boy fell through and died. if you look there sometimes you can see two glowing, what we call, eyes. Curtains open and close during rehearsals and performances. The crawl space door to the catwalk opens and slams shut, even though now it's kept looked. Lights flicker on off, especially the spotlights. The students know him as "Red Eyes", no one has yet to see him.
