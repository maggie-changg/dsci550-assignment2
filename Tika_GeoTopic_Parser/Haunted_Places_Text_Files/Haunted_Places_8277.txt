Location: Insane Asylum

Description:
You will walk in rooms with no windows and feel a cool breeze come across your body. There is a morgue in the basement and at sometimes you can see dead ghosts lying in the morgue trays. You hear footsteps walking down the 3-floor building steps, and can feel presence behind you. This is the all-time best place to go to if you want to be frightened.
