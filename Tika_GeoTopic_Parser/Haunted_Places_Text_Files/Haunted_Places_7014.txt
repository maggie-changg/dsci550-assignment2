Location: Benedictine University

Description:
Benedictine Hall - There is a little room up there with a chair, a small window and there is supposedly white writings all over the walls. Also in Ben Hall there have been reportings of people talking late at night in the Art wing, but when explored, no one is there. Another thing to note is the banging on the walls and the siting of a monk that will appear out of nowherand then turn and walk into the wall and is gone. - June 2005 Update: It has been torn down and is now a parking lot.
