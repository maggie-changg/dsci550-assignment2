Location: Neutrogena, Johnson &amp; Johnson Corporation

Description:
There is a total of three ghosts here at Neutrogena. The original founders wife was shot execution style here and so was his son. Workers and security officers working late nights will see a woman in a white dress walking around, a child playing in the factory and running (there are no children allowed in the buildings due to the hazards), and a strange growl.
