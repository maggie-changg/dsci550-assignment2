Location: Winona State College

Description:
Lourdes Hall - 4th floor- The fourth floor used to be an infirmary for the nuns that lived there. Many people died up here and you can still hear many of them walking, crying, or just trying to talk to you. It is rather chilling, especially if you have lived there!!!!
