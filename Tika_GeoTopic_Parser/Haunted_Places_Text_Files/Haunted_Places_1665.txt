Location: Saint Mary's Cemetery

Description:
Very strange noises, like the sound of a dog jogging on cement, a strange light what seemed to be a white glow stick go by very fast, but the oddest of them all was the Unexplainable feeling of evil, the feeling of being watched, and being rushed and overwhelmed with a negative energy.
