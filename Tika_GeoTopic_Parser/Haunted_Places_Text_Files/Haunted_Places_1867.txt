Location: Charles Grill

Description:
Corner of Garey & Holt. St -  Multiple entities, footsteps, slamming doors, arguments, apparitions, physical phenomena such as potted trees whose tops touch the floor for a few minutes and then spring to original position. Whatever is there does definitely like to share the space with the living.
