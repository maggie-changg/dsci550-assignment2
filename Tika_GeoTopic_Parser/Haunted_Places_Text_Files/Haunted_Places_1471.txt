Location: Stonehill College

Description:
A small passenger plane crashed into the pond several years ago, and on the anniversary the pond gets covered with a blue mist and goes on to become a thick fog throughout the rest of campus. As it begins to clear, some say they see the pilot struggling to get out of the cockpit and climb onto drier land.
