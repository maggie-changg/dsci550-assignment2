Location: Haunted Bridge

Description:
In the 1800's a wealthily family in the area owned slaves. One day one of the slaves became very angry with his master, so that night he took his master's beautiful young daughter out to what back then was a covered bridge and cut her head off with an axe. It is said that you can drive up on the bridge, roll your car windows down, and turn the car off; you can hear the sound of the axe hitting the chopping block.
