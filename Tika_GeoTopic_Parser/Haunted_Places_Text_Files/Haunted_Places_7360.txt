Location: The Fox River Front

Description:
At the Fox River Front there is a dam. Many people think that since it is small they can get their canoes, boats, ext. over it. Well, you can't. Therefore they drown. There have been several drownings there. Around 1:00 a.m., Saturday, you can see a family of 3. The father is holding a canoe paddle, the mother is crying, and the girl that is about 11 is holding a life jacket. They start walking from the dam, through the river back to the river front, before they get onto the river front, they disappear.
