Location: Slaton Cemetery- Blue Light Cemetery

Description:
This is due to the various occurrences to locals such as a young couple went to the cemetery to make-out one night , and were found several days later laid against a tombstone with their faces frozen in fear. It is said that if you go into the cemetery after dark, you will see a blue light floating around the cemetery. If you go in the middle of summer, you will reach places in the cemetery that are ice cold, also there are bushes planted inside that if stood in front of on a still day, one side of the bush will be moving as though being struck by a tornado. One report is of a man in his car actually being pulled inside the cemetery with his car not going into any gear but drive while something outside was calling his name repeatedly. It is a matter of belief, but I have been both during the day and at night, and I wouldn't recommend doing so unless you are a believer of faith, and a strong believer of paranormal activities.
