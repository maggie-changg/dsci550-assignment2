Location: Triangular Field

Description:
Located above the Devil's Den, Confederate sharpshooters have been sighted on the rocks down at the bottom of the field, at the end of the woods, prepared to shoot. They have also been heard resounding their famous "rebel yells" and have been known to actually cause "impressions" in the grass, coming towards visitors in the field. Union cannon can be heard as well as screaming and moaning of wounded/dying soldiers all throughout the field. Union soldiers have been sighted at the left of the gate-entrance of the field and have been known to approach visitors. Incidentally, many visitors have experienced their photographic equipment does NOT function in the Triangular Field ~ no matter how new or state-of-the-art their equipment may be! Distant drums have been reportedly heard by many, many visitors here.
