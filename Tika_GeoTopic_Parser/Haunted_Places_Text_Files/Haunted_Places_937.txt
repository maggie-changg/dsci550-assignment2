Description:
Bolton Mansion grounds - . While sledding in the winter, a witness reports a few times they had looked up at the top floor window, and saw what was clearly a Revolutionary Soldier looking out, and the area itself has the overall feeling of unrest and even dread. They also remember quite vividly when they went on a tour of the mansion, that there were significant temperature changes, for example, when you first walk in, itâ€™s a nice 72 degrees, but at various places it seemed like the temp dropped suddenly and you just get a feeling like something very wrong went on there.
