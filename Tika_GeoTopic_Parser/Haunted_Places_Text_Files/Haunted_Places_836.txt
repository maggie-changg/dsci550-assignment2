Location: Lock Haven University

Description:
Sloan Hall- The university arts building, is haunted--by three ghosts: one a woman draped in white, very calming (seen mostly in the main stage theatre area), the second a feeling of a curious child (but nothing seen--generally in the studio theatre on the third floor) and lastly a black, fast moving blur of a spirit, very menacing.
