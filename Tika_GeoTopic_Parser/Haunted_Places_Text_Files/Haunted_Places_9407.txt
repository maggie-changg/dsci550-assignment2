Location: The Baumgartner house

Description:
Located directly across the street from the cemetery. Built and owned by the first undertaker of the town. Haunted by three family members. A woman, probably the original owner's wife dressed in a blue dress, a dark haired attractive man, and a slender tall man with a short hair cut wearing a long john shirt and slacks. Seen frequently in rooms not being used for a period of time and then used again. Ghosts here don't seem to want to be noticed much. These ghosts interact with the surroundings and are quite visible.
