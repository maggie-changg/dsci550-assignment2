Location: DuBois Central Catholic (Old Building, now part of DRMC West)

Description:
One of the old Headmasters likes to shut out lights and mess with the doors. And a little kid runs up and down the hallways. Theirs also another ghost that no one knows who it is, but it looks out the cafeteria windows.
