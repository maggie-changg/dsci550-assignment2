Location: Rail Road tracks

Description:
is a railroad crossing in San Antonio that is said to be haunted. Some children were on a school bus when it stalled and the train hit the bus killing them all. If you go to that area at nightfall on the anniversary the arms will come down the lights will blink and you will here a train and feel wind but there is no train. You will feel your car being pushed away from the tracks even in park. If you dust baby powder on the hood of you car you will see imprints of little hands in the powder and when the "train" is gone your car will have been moved back several feet. We went with 5 other cars and all cars had hand prints and each car had been pushed back about 4 feet.
