Location: Holy Sepulcher Cemetery

Description:
There is said to be a woman in white roaming the cemetery. She usually rests in one place. People have witnessed a candle burning at all hours of the night, even when the wind picks up. The candle flame appears to change color and shape, not actually flickering, but changing shapes. It will go from being a complete circle, to a half circle with a defined edge to being tear shaped. This light is in the same place every time.
