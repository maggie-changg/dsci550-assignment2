Location: Huntington Beach High School

Description:
Young man named George hung himself in the middle of a play in the auditorium. If he doesn't know you will be performing, he will play tricks on you or hurt you. Performers must sign a paper and put it where his rope is. If the rope is removed, the next play will be ruined. Sets have fallen, been broken, and disappeared with no way to take them out in the first place. People forget lines, lose their voice, are hit with falling sets or lights (never fatal). Nooses used in a play will undo themselves.
