Location: Mount Saint Mary's

Description:
Brady Hall - there have been students "oppressed" by spirits. Doors open by themselves. With a whole English class present, the poem "the Living Hand" was being read. During the poem, the door open and then slammed. The teacher checked and no one was there. The doors are designed so that you have to turn the knob to open them and they are difficult to slam.
