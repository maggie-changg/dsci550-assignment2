Location: Fox Tower Cemetery

Description:
A small cemetery with few graves. Upon passing through the gate the air temp feels a lot cooler. At night, you can hear footsteps throughout the cemetery, yet no one is around. A few ghostly sightings have occurred, however only the people who live around the cemetery have seen anything.
