Location: Nettleton High School Gym/ Band room

Description:
The band keeps their instruments in a room under the bleachers. One day, three friends were putting their instruments up. It was too early in the morning for anyone to be out in the gym. It was supposed to be locked, and the janitor had finished cleaning. When they put up the instruments, they heard a blood-curdling scream. They ran from the band room to the gym. It was locked. Nothing could get in, unless it was something hard to explain. They ran back to the band room. At first, the trio was skeptical, because it was the day before the band Halloween party and they thought that it was a prank. They went back to their instruments. Then again, they heard the screaming. Except, it sounding like someone was yelling for someone or something to quit. The three ran from the band room, leaving the instruments behind. From that day you can still hear the yelling if you are there quite early in the morning, standing in the Nettleton High Band Room. - One night after a band party, a group of band members decided to run around in the gym. It was pretty late, and almost everyone had gone home. The group had split-up and decided to go up to the cheerleading room. There they found that the room was extremely cold, and for some odd reason they couldn't find the light switch. After leaving the cheerleading room, they heard screams and ran down the stairs where the screams came from. Now these weren't any ordinary screams. They were the kind of screams that you would only hear if someone was being stabbed or hurt. There was no explanation for the screams, because no one else was there at the time. The whole group got to the bottom of the stairs to find leaves falling from the ceiling of the gym, as if it were a tree. One of the girls in the group saw the shadow of what looked like a football player. They all tho ught that this was a joke, until they heard a door slam and then saw another door swinging.
