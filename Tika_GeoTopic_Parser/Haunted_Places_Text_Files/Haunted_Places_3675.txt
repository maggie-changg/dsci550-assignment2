Location: The Hangin' Tree

Description:
At the junction of the Pea River and the Choctahatchee River is the largest oak tree many have seen. It sits alone on about a half acre, but plenty of others are on its outskirts. This is where mainly unjustly accused black men were hung long ago. To this day, a fifty foot diameter is around the tree where nothing grows. Kids will play around it, but won't get on its limbs.
