Description:
It is said that if you go to room D15 late at nights you can hear the rhythmic sounds of a click. There was a college student that use to live in this dorm room that had obsessive compulsive disorder with Rubik's Cubes. When sent to the state hospital after attacking a fellow dorm mate for stealing his Cube, he killed himself but still haunts the room for his toy of joy.
