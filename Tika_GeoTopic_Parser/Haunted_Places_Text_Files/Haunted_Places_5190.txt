Location: Brown Street Educational School

Description:
In the downstairs bathroom there was a boy desperate and tired of being picked on. He untied his shoestrings and hung himself in the 2nd stall from the door. If you go to the school around 9pm when no one is there you would notice his favorite classroom light on up stairs. And after night school don't stay around the school for to long cause by personal experience you will see the front door close and feel someone standing right next to you. What makes it bad you can feel them breathing.
