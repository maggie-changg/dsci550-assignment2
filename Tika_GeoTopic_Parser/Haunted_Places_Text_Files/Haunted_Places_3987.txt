Location: Fairfield Middle School

Description:
at the middle school it is said to be that there is a little boy that was about 12 had gotten into trouble with the principle and was scared of his parents. So right after school in the 200 wing by the Spanish room he had broken the mirror that is in the bathrooms and had killed himself. The next day they had found him in one of the stalls cut up but they don't if he really did it to himself or someone else did because he was cut up in like 5 pieces. Some teachers had said after school when there is only 5 or 6 teachers in the building they can here sounds as in screaming coming from the boys bathroom. Now if you go in there you can see bloodstains in the last bathroom stall. And sometimes if your in there alone maybe you should get out because he's still looking for the principle that made this horrible thing that had happened. And this is true.
