Location: The Bieker House

Description:
Update: Burned down - The beaker house is very well known in Munster Indiana. A woman dressed in white can be seen during day or night. The house is vacant [for years],and known for it's huge red barn. It is owned by the city. As at one time, the city offered the huge house and property "rent-free" &"utility-free" to anyone willing to live in the house for the purpose of preventing vandalism to the house & grounds. No offers were ever met - Update: the big red beaker barn has burned down, there was an electrical fire, and now its just the house.
