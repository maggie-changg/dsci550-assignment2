Location: Abandoned train tunnel

Description:
Tunnel is located in the middle of the woods. On some night temperature drops several degrees and if you walk into the tunnel a train can be heard coming from within. -  February 2005 additional info: in its time it was the second longest tunnel in Massachusetts. Weird echo vibrations, due to the length of the tunnel pass back and forth. Pigeons nest on both ends of the tunnel. Add their cooing and people talking and general noise from walking meshing into an eerie sound it is hard to figure out what you are actually hearing. when you walk down it, you get the sensation the end of the tunnel keeps getting further away from you. It could be an optical illusion.
