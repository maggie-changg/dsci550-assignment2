Location: Ed Trays Hill

Description:
There was a white man killed by a few black men when the KKK was still at large. He was hung from a tree, his head buried beneath him. To this day, you still can hear fo`t steps, rocks being kicked, and laughter of what sounds like older men. Even a few say that scratches appear on their arms!
