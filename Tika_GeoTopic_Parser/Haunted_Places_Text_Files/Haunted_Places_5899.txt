Location: Bender Park

Description:
story has it about 80 years ago. A farmer went crazy and killed his family and neighbors with an ax. Since then all of the houses in that area have been removed but when you walk down the road and near the area YOU will never forget the feeling that covers over you. to find the hermit walk towards the lake on FITZSIMMOMS RD. when you get to the woods look left you will see a dirt hill that is all that is left of his road, Plevoc road. Remember do not go looking for him alone out there you are a member of the food chain. - March 2008 correction: No farmer ever went crazy in oak creek. for the houses they feel off the cliff or were removed when road workers found an Indian burial hill there.
