Location: Sacred Heart Catholic Church

Description:
There have been at times a woman seen in a turn-of-the-century bridal dress by many parishioners weeping in the side chapel of Our Lady of Guadalupe. It is believed to be the ghost of a young Mexican woman who was left at the altar and died not long after. She comes back in hoping that her deserting groom will come back.
