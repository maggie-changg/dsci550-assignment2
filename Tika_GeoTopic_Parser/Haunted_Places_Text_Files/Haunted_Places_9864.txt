Location: Hill Park

Description:
there is a private historic cemetery, where Frank James is buried, along with two confederate soldiers and others. The submitter claims to have seen on one occasion what appears to be a figure, more of a light, misty glow, walk over the hill. Their neighbors claim to have seen it before and the locals say it is a soldier who was killed in battle there in 1862(63?)
