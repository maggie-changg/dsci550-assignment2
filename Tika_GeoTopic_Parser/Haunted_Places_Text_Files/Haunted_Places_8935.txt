Description:
A successful businessman worked at this building through the 1980's. His name was Harold and on the 13th of September 1989, he died from unexplained reasons in his office at approximately 9 p.m. His spirit has been seen in the fire exit/ stairways by a few working in the building. They have reportedly seen a man walking between the 13th and 14th floors with blood falling from his eyes and a look of shear death on his face. When they follow him into the hallway he disappears without a trace.
