Location: Downtown

Description:
'I' and 10th Street Clinic - Was on route for Trail of Tears where the Indians had stopped and made camp. It is said that a young girl died in the winter during their stay. Now it's a Clinic up top a small hill across the street from La Porte High School Baseball Field on 'I' and 10th Streets. People say that the elevator is played with, also the lower level bathroom is often locked from inside with no windows leading outside, and various objects moving across rooms (my understanding- chairs mostly).
