Location: Turkeyfoot Creek Bridge

Description:
It is said that if you cross the bridge coming from Malinta at night, a ghostly Indian warrior can be seen riding a white stallion along the creek to the right of the bridge. He protects $40,000 in gold that is supposedly buried along the south bank of the creek. Those who look for the treasure have reported being trampled by the specter horse.
