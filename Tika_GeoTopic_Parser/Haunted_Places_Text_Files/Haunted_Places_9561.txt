Location: Enzian Theatre

Description:
While watching films guests have seen a disembodied head of a woman in the north corner of the room. The head will appear suddenly and float from one corner to the next screaming emphatically only to disappear in the next-door restaurant named Nicole St. Pierre. For reasons unknown, the head is present only on moonless nights at 1:00AM.
