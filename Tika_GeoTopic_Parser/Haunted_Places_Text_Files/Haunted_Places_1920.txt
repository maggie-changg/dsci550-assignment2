Location: Mount Rubidoux

Description:
If you ever take the time to visit this location, it is said that late at night, old spirits can be seen walking the tops of the rough terrain. In your ramblings across the area, you are also likely to find a tiny picture encased in the jagged rock of Mt. Rubidoux, which appears to be a portrait of Jesus Christ. Not strange enough for you? It used to appear as the Mother Mary!
