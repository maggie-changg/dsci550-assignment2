Description:
Located on Mount Anthony. There are great photos of supernatural images, like the statues, you can see in the photo. The seminary closed and turned into a co-ed college (southern Vermont college). According to years of students/staff doing night security, this is what haunts the house: the second wife (common), Everett himself (rarely though), and a person in a black hooded robe (most seen). Common occurrence: smoke filled hallways, lights turn on in room that are locked, door/windows unlocked after being locked on the previous security round, footsteps all around the college when no one else is in the building. The 2 main haunts in this mansion is the 3rd floor: Abbey room is burning with energy. Now a classroom, was the sleeping quarters for house staff (maid hung herself.
