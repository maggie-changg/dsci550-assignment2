Location: The old PSJA Auditorium

Description:
It has been said that in the old auditorium years ago a janitor or tech was putting up a light on the top and he fell and died. Till this day if you look up the light has never been placed. The story is if you happen to do a production there, you have to put his name in the program because if not he will do something to ruin the show. Either drop the set, or something else horrid.
