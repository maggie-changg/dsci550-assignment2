Location: Dead Man's Trail

Description:
Dead Man's Trail is an old Indian trail that runs along the river. It's been told that Indians have been seen along the trail, chilly breezes from out of nowhere, and people have mysteriously died years back on that trail. I've heard there is an old cave that had to be closed up and hidden in rocks for reasons unknown. Trails that were used by Indians many years ago can still be seen going across the river, which was much lower back then. When you walk along this trail, you can't help but notice the dead silence.
