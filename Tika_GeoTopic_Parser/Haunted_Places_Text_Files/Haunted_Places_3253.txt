Location: Imo Cemetery

Description:
there is said to be a glowing head stone in the cemetery but when you walk  up  to the head stone it will stop glowing and if you go south of the head stone  there are claw marks on another head stone and if you go to the back of the cemetery there is an old Indian burial ground they say you can hear voices and people touching you.- April 2004 Addition - the Imo story about the grave has been completely investigated and is in fact tower lights across the street from the cemetary that give a reflection off the marker... the burning effect takes place as soon as it gets dark and goes away as soon as it gets light, when you walk up to it - at any point you can clearly see the lights in the background... from the ground point of view. It does infact look like it is on fire, esp from the road at night but is in fact only an illusion.
