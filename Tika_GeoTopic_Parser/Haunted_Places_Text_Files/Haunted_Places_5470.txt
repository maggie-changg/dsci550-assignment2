Location: Erie Canal Towpath

Description:
North side - The distance is a mere 1.5 miles between Canastota and Wampsville. There is a spot you actually can walk into an unseen mass but can be felt. It feels like walking into a blanket hanging on a clothesline. It is possible if you can encounter it to trace its contours. It is thought to be a draft horse standing facing westward.  April Additional information - know of a young man in high school that commited who was about 17 years old committed suicide in the area because of problems with his girlfriend. This may be a reason for the haunting.
