Description:
Room 15 - Many guests and staff testify that it is not uncommon to hear whispering and laughter coming from this empty room. There is also a Theatre Room Museum on the second floor, where dust on the beds reveals the outlines of sleeping guests, leaving adjacent areas intact and undisturbed. A former chambermaid's ghost has also been sighted.
