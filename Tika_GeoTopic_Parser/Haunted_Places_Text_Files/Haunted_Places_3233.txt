5 miles east of town, there is a large black post standing alone just south of the highway. this post marks the road where several blacks that were in washita county were hung. if you drive south almost 2 miles, there are many large, old oak trees. It is said that many people driving the road at night have seen outlines and silhouettes of the black people who were hung in the trees, and some have even seen small groups of white men on horseback holding lanterns, with the thick ropes they used draped across the saddles of the horses.
