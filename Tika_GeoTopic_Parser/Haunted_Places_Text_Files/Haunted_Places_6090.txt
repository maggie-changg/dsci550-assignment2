Description:
Bartlett Hall  - Bartlett shows all signs of being haunted. This past Halloween, a "not exactly prohibited but very extremely hush hush" haunted house was held in the attics of Bartlett. Whilst setting up, students underwent lights flickering, doors shutting, and vast temperature changes. It got to the point that they were ready to stop bothering with their set up; simply take money and usher people through the rooms. However, to their great disappointment, subsequent trips have yielded nothing in comparison to October 30th.
