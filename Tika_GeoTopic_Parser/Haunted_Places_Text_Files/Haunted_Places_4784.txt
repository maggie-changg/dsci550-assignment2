Location: Miners Cemetery

Description:
It is a site where a mine ran under a part of early Dawson Springs. The mine was abandoned and eventually collapsed taking the houses on top of it down with it. At night if you stay you will see a strange fog come in, after that you will hear rocks start to fall.
