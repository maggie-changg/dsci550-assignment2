Location: Ocean-Born Mary House

Description:
Believed to be haunted by Mary Wallace. The apparition of a six-foot-tall woman, with red hair and flashing green eyes started to appear in the upstairs windows or on the central staircase. Some even saw Maryâ€™s ghost riding through the hills in a phantom coach drawn by four horses. Her apparition was often seen in the yard, throwing something down the well. Many of them reported feeling the presence of Ocean-Born Mary. Her ghost was once seen helping family members repair a garage during a fierce storm, and several subsequent owners believe her presence protects the house from harm. Recently two New Hampshire State Troopers Reported seeing the specter a tall, red-haired woman wearing colonial clothing crossing the road just below the old mansion.
