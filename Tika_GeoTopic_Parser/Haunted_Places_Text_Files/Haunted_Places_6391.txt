Location: Montecarlo Restaurant

Description:
Upstairs there is a room used for banquets. The upstairs used to have apartments, but they were gutted by a fire in the early 1990's and remolded. There is a ghost that shakes what sounds like a key ring full of keys. Often the ghost shakes them right next to people's ears. There are cold spots, and the ceiling fanlights go on and off at will.
