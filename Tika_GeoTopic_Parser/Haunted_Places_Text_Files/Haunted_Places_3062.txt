Location: W. Belcrest Rd (Riggie)

Description:
When you are in the basement you hear boxes flying across the room. When one of the current owner's kids woke up one night, she screamed at the sight of a man standing near her closet then trying to hold her hand. The other sighting was a little girl singing and spinning in circles. Footsteps heard and cold spots felt.
