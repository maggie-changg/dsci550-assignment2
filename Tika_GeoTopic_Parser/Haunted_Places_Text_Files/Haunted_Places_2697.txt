Location: Roosevelt Hotel

Description:
A stop at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is a must, as at least two famous, and several not so famous ghosts reside there. The hotel's most famous haunting concerns a mirror which sits outside the elevators on the hotel's lower level. The mirror originally was part of the furnishings in a room which was frequently used by Marilyn Monroe. Several people have reported seeing the tragic actress' image reflected in the glass of this particular mirror.
