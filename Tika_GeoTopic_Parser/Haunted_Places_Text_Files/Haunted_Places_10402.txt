Location: Tilcon

Description:
haunted by a man killed while working at the plant workers report machines turning on by themselves, lanterns carried with no one there, see him standing on the catwalks, smell smoke around them while no one is there, feeling like someone is watching you, strobes of lights have been spotted floating around.
