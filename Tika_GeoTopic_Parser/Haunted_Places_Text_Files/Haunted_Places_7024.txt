Description:
former funeral home - A Ft Wayne based hospital bought an old funeral home to house it's home health care agency. Lots of problems with electrical system, things moving about on their own like chairs, etc. Staff is reluctant to be in the building alone---especially at night when the activity increases. One of the employee's young children began asking her mother about various people she saw moving about the building. The mother didn't know how to respond because she couldn't see them.
