Location: Emerson Majestic Theatre

Description:
Built in 1903, the Majestic has been noted as one of the most haunted theatres in the district. A mayor of the city died in the theatre during a performance and today he is still seen in his seat. There is also a little girl and a married couple dressed in turn of the century clothes that haunt the now un-used balcony.
