Location: Loveladies Bridge

Description:
Twenty years ago, a woman and her baby died in a car accident on the bridge. It is said that if you go to the middle of the bridge at night and say, "Lovelady, Lovelady, I got your baby!" three times, she will appear on the other end of the bridge and walk towards you, looking for her baby.
