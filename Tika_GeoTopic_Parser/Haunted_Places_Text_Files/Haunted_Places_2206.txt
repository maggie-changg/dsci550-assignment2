Location: Fox Hallow French Immersion School

Description:
February 2007 correction: Formerly listed as Fox Hallow Elementary School - Many people have spotted a ghosts named Opal there. At night you can always hear someone saying "Opla" over and over again. The playground shakes as if someone is playing on it.
