Location: Monkey Bridge

Description:
It is said that in the early part of when Athens was being built a circus came into town by train to entertain the citizens of Athens. When the train was just about to arrive to the town it wrecked underneath a bridge in Athens. All the animals died, but the interesting thing was that body of the monkeys were never found. If you go there late in the night and put white powder on top of your car and sit and wait, you will see paw prints on the top of your car.
