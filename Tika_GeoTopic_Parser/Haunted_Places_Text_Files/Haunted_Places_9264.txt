Description:
TOWER - First, in room 471, in the summer of 1999, a businessman was out of town staying in this room.  He was walking around the pool (next to this room) for most of the evening and into the night hours.  When the pool closed a maintenance man told him that he would have to leave the pool was closed.  This is the last anyone would see of this gentleman because, the next day when he was supposed to check out and did not, a maid went to the room to check things out.  Upon walking into the room, she found the man had committed suicide with a 357.  He had also left a $3.57 tip on the table.  Many have claimed to see a shadow walking around the pool at night in the windows of the rooms around the pool.  Next, in the early 1980's, a boy scout group had rented the entire 7th. Floor of the building.  This is hard to accurately describe, since no one who was working there at the time cares to elaborate on any details from this event, but all that was gathered is that the boy scout leader had apparently gone crazy and killed some of the scouts before being caught.  When the building was closed for the winter one year (Gatlinburg is a tourist town which is really only full for the summer and autumn months) an employee was making rounds through the building and stopped on the 7 th. Floor and heard running and screams he ran to check for intruders only to find nothing, no rooms were rented in the Tower that evening.
