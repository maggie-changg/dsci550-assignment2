Description:
It is said that a spirit of a teenage boy by the name of Toby haunts the small, old auditorium. Rumor has it that the boy was a member of the drama club. He got his heart broken by a girl he had a crush on. He hung himself from the catwalk above the stage. It has been said that the ghostly image of his body can be seen hanging from the catwalk.
