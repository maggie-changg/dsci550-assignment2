Location: Railroad Crossing

Description:
A railroad worker by the name of Jake, not sure of the date, fell asleep on the tracks one night and was decapitated when the train came through. Every night after midnight he appears. Lights can be seen down the tracks (there is no other crossing), you will hear a train but there is none, and he'll walk towards you with his lantern.
