Description:
Find your way to the center of the campus, around 1:00am and you will likely feel someone or something there with you. On many occasions you can hear screaming and Yelling as if a mob is chasing someone through the old campus. On rare occasions you will see multiple apparitions come running through the campus center, one being chased by a group of 10-15.
