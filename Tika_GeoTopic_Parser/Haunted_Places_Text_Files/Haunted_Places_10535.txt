Location: St. Odilia

Description:
in one of the classrooms there is a light that flickers. Every time it flickers, someone gets hurt. Once the light flickered and a student fell out of his middle school desk, and broke his arm.Â  Once the light flickered and a boy got his head stuck in between a playground toy. Paramedics had to rescue him. Once the light flickered and a boy had a seizure in church. Now if you come to St. Odilia you have to be extra careful for flickering lights.
