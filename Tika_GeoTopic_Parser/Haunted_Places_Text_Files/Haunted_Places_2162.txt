Location: The Argonutua Beach House

Description:
Some people claim that this beach house is haunted by the ghost of Ghengis Hansel, a man who mysteriously disappeared there after the storm in 1952. People who have stayed in the house have felt a foreboding presence, especially around the many secret doors and compartments, all of which are locked tightly shut.
