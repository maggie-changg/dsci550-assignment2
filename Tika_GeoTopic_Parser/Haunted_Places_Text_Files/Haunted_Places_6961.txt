Location: Shoe Factory Road

Description:
Abandoned House - This isn't much of a haunting, but if you go West on Shoe Factory Road past Rohrsson Ave., there will be an abandoned barn on your right side. Directly after the barn, on your left side there will be a "No Passing Zone" sign, even closer, after the sign; there is a white, stone house. I have heard from a resident nearby, that it was an old schoolhouse. I went in with some friends and there are many odd things written on the walls, such as: "Die", "XIV", and a picture of a large eye that is bleeding, with a diamond at the end of the trail of blood. - October 10, 2007 the building was torn down.
