Description:
Chaminade University - Hale Hoaloha - In this dorm you can hear two little kids voices. The voices sound like they are playing ball. The voices are on the even side on the 3rd. 9-16-02, Late night/early morning, every computer, light, and water fountain turned on and seemed to have a mind of their own. In the morning three students had the same exact dream of kids laughing and the sound of death coming from the earth.
