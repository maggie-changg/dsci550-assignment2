Location: Binghams light

Description:
It is said back in the early 1800's a man's two children became missing in a snow storm. The man went in search of his children and never returned and neither did his children. It is said if you drive into the woods by a dirt road you will see his lantern glowing in the distance. It is also said if you scream to the light that you have his children the light will turn red. There are no reports of anyone getting close to the light but if you wait long enough maybe the light will come to you.- December Update: Bingham's lights appear close to the old cemetery, which is actually split into two sections, one on each of two hilltops. If you drive down the road between the graveyards towards the woods you will see the lights. It works best if you get out and walk in that direction. - February 2007 Update: Reported that the place is now gated off, presumably due to people shooting at light.
