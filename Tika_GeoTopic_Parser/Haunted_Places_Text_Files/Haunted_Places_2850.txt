Description:
Dykstra Hall - Supposedly there is a lively spirit still hovering over the third floor of the dormitory, where a couple of years ago a young student (overwhelmed by life) committed suicide by hanging himself in the dormitory closet. It is said that the kid killed himself across from one of the restrooms, where creepy noises can be heard during the night.
