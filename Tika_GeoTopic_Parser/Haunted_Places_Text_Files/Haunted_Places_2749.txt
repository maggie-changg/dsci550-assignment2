Location: Damien High School

Description:
Towards dusk a large, fast moving white mist-like cloud can be seen moving across campus in the direction of the football field. It has also been observed moving across the football field. The 400 building towards the south of the school nearby by the gym is rumored to be haunted by an unknown spirit. Late at night, it's rumored you can see the hallway lights turn on by themselves and then see a shadow walking the hallway, but there's nobody there when one tries to look.
