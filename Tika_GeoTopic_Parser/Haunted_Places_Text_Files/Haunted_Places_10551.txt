many instances happen especially the darkroom. The spirit playfully moves objects around and changes the time on the timer. It is said that a wealthy man (carpenter whose studio was in the darkroom) lived there and was cheating on his wife with the maid. after refusing to leave his wife the maid hung herself on the main stairwell banister. The late night janitors experience sounds and lights on/off nightly and hear children. One employee saw the man in his flannel.
