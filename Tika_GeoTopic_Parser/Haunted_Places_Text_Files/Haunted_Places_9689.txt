Location: Old Jail

Description:
This jail was built at the turn of the century by Henry Flagler because the jail across from his magnificent hotel was offensive to his "newport clientele" It is located north of the old town on San Marco. Tour guides and tourists alike have experienced the sound of shuffling feet, the smell of putrid unwashed bodies and sanitary facilities(a bucket for 4 prisoners), cold spots and even a shadow entity of an extremely large man- sheriff Perry ( the first sheriff) was over 6'5" tall. Students have even seen a man in a "funky plaid suit" in the main cell block.
