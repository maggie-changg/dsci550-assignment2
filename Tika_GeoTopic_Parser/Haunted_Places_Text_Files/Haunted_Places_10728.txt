Description:
Wilson Hall - there is a stairway to the bell tower.  Legend has it that two men were arguing up there and one was pushed off.  This is a ANGRY ghost.  The door to the bell tower is locked.  The ghost is said to have red eyes.  I personally have not seen it, but one of my classmates did.
