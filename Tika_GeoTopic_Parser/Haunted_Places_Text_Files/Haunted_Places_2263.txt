Location: Eastern Oregon Correctional Institute (EOCI)

Description:
Formerly a State Mental Hospitol - Guards have stated hearing people down below yelling: "help, help, help." - March 2004 Update:Before being converted to a correctional institution, it was a state mental hospital. It was converted possibly sometime early in the 1990's. This might be the root of the "help, help, help" cries.
