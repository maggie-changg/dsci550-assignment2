Description:
Tilly Willy Bridge - In a secluded area down an old dirt road, a woman and her children ran off a narrow concrete bridge, down to their deaths, reportedly in the 1970's. Since then, their ghosts are spotted crossing the bridge in a phantom car. The woman is also seen in a white dress, twirling in the nearby fields late at night. There are also sightings of a green, goblin-like creature.
