Location: End of March 2005

Description:
construction crews found a shallow grave containing human bones ...after several weeks of investigating...they found 50 unmarked graves. County officials researched with the help of Bowling Green University to find records of cemetery belonging to the children's home. no cemetery existed!! They even went back through the Lucas County Coroners records - could not find anything about the deaths. The City of Maumee, Lucas County Commissioners and The Developer each donated $16,000 to have the bodies laid to rest at the Riverside Cemetery in Maumee.
