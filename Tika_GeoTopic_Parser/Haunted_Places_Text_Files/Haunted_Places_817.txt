Location: Indiantown Gap

Description:
Green Point - Moonshine church & Cemetery - Driving up the hill(Rt.443) to the church at night(church on the left/cemetery on the right) IF you dare to stop(especially at Halloween) around midnight chances your car will shut offWeird noises can be heard around the whole area. Among various paranormal phenomena, the most commonly reported is that of car engines cutting out when being driven past the cemetery. Also it's said that a girl went into the church and said The Lord's Prayer backwards and was struck dead by lightening. Also in and around the same area(Indiantown Gap),it's said that The "Headless Horseman" rides through the valley looking for a new head. - March 2005 Correction: Earlier submitted that you see blue eyes in the trees at the end of the cemetery, supposedly the "Blue-Eyed Six" were hung there for murdering a man. The cemetery at this church is said to be haunted by the Blue-Eyed Six, a gang that murdered a local man and whose members were all subsequently hung in the cemetery as punishment(a play has been written about this event and was possibly copyrighted). This information is NOT TRUE. The Blue Eyed Six were never related in any way to the church or it's cemetery. Although all these things occured within this area more or less. They never were hung in the cemetery or buried there, nor is it believed they would have any reason to haunt this place as they have no worldy connections. The Blue eyed six were all caught and tried in the Lebanon County Court House, hung in thecourtyard of the Lebanon County prison except Josiah Hummel who died in Prison, and all were buried seperatly on their individual homesteads. Many in the area where brought up to believe the Moonshine Church and the entire wooded area of Indiantown Gap was haunted by what is known as THE RED DEVIL! The submitter of the correction is also submitting a personal experience and will be posted when we get a link.
