Location: Croyleton Stables

Description:
It's Somerset Pike, horse farm. A caretaker was killed in the late 1800's. He was kicked in the head by a horse and shortly thereafter died. He still inhabits the barn and lower field. On summer nights you can hear horses neighing and then a scream. You can also see him wandering around occasionally.
