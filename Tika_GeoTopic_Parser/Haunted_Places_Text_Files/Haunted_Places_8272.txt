Description:
Getman-Babcock Dormitory - In the girl's freshman dorm, Getman-Babcock, there is an orange ghost/outline of a person, usually found in the lobby of the dorm. In the basement, if the door is shut to the laundry room, the handle turns on its own. Also, sometimes, there is a little girl in a blue dress wearing black dressy shoes that appears on the stairs in the lobby. Other weird occurrences have been seen and heard in the dormitory.
