Location: Congress Inn

Description:
Early one Saturday morning in 1987 a visitor was awaken by someone sitting on the back of their legs at their knees, they were unable to turn over for maybe 10 to 15 seconds. They later ask some locals if they knew of any thing like that happening before, They were told that the motel office had been used for a hospital in the civil war, and that at one time the fighting was so severe that they had to bury their dead by cementing them in the walls of the basement.
