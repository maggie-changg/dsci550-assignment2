Location: Holly Ridge railroad tracks

Description:
A long time ago there was the conductor of the train and him and one of his workers got into a fight and the worker decapitated the conductors head and now the conductor comes back every night in a red orb so you go to the rail road tracks and turn off your car and roll down your window and wait for it to come when you see it start your car before it gets to you or the conductor will take your soul.
