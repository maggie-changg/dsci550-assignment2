Description:
Wolverine World Wide-hh puppy shoes) factory F-sole plant/3rd shift-ghost shift - Known only as shadow man, he stands over employees that are trying to ignore him, he will follow some into the bathroom, he even goes into his own stall, he will follow you to break and pull out a chair to rest then when break is over he will push his chair back to the table, he may even shut off the lights for no reason. Perhaps only a disembodied spirit who can't leave until the jobs done! I wrote a short story and interviewed supervisor and others.
