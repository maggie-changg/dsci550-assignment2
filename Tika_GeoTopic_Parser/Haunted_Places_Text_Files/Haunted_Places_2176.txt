Location: Primrose Lane

Description:
If you drive down to the end of the road where the pavement turns into dirt, drive down the path a little bit and turn off your lights. If you sit there for a little while, you will see a figure of a man and his dog. The man is carrying a rifle. It is said that a man was hunting out there long ago and shot himself. If you walk through the woods, some people have said that the manâ€™s dog will come up to you, and then vanish in front of your eyes.
