Location: old Fredericktown rd off of oo hwy.

Description:
If you drive about a half mile down this gravel road and look off into the woods on the right side, you can see where there is a cleared off place in the woods and an old tire swing hanging from a tree. It is said that an old man and his daughter lived there many years ago until she was ran over by a train (the tire swing was hers.) If you stop in front of this spot at midnight and turn off your engine and headlights, weird things will happen. There have been reports of windows fogging up, cars not restarting, and the faint sound of a little girl laughing along with the sound of a train.
