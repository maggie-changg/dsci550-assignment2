Location: Jefferson High School

Description:
Sometime in the 1970s a kid was climbing up the stairs in the auditorium to get some props. While he was climbing up there he apparently fell and died. Now there is a railing and a fence at the top of the prop room and across from that is a painting of a guy falling.
