Location: Wolf Mansion

Description:
As the story goes. back in the day, the owner killed all of his slaves, even their children after slavery was made illegal. Some have even said he went crazy and killed his family, dismembered the bodies, hide them and then shot himself. Sometimes you can see the light in the bell tower come on for no reason and there is no switch for it. People have been seen in the windows when the house was not occupied. Orbs have been spotted. One person who did an install at the house claims that when in the basement they felt breathing down their neck and that something brushed against their hair. When coming back up the stairs, something was passing along their heels. Reports of doors opening and closing by themselves and things missing and showing back up .Hauntings include ring of the bell in the bell tower(there is no bell anymore),monks walking around, and screams.
