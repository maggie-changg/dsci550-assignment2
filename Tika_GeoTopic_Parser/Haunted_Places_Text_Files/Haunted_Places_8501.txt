Location: The woodlands

Description:
Terramont Park - This is a very new park, and while the park was being built 3 men died in a truck from heat exhaustion. Now when you are at the park at night, it is said that you will suddenly get really hot flashes. Some people claim to see a truck parked out on the field, which as they get close, vanishes into the woods
