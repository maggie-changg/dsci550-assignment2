Location: Major Grahm's Mansion

Description:
Owned by a slave owner, he tortured and killed many of his slaves. He burned down a slave house with over 100 men, women, and children inside. Coming close to the house, you get the sensation of pain and anger. Lights turn on and off, even though there are no electrical cables. Curtains move. You can here someone going up and down the stairs. Bloody handprints sometimes stain the basement, which is where cages are and where slaves were kept and tortured. There is a guillotine there also. If you stay too long, you will start to here voices, screaming, babies crying, and lots of yelling. Be careful. Many who enter this house say they always bring out something with them. If you drive by the place late at night, there are lights on, and there is no electricity to the house, and a figure that walks by the attic window, and the gates are rusted shut, and there are no cars. There is one specific light that shines at you, then the light turns into two lights, then three, then one again, and then all of a sudden the lights go out, and then back on again. - September Correction: formerly listed as being in Foster Falls. There is electricity run to the house. There are "No Trespassing" signs on every other tree. - November 2005 Correction: Graham was a slaveholder, but he never tortured or murdered over 100 slaves. That would have indeed brought the authorities, even in the South. 100 slaves would represent a vast fortune. A local slave owner named McGavock never mentioned the stories formerly submitted in his extensive diaries and they were close neighbors and friends. The house is indeed supposed to be haunted.
