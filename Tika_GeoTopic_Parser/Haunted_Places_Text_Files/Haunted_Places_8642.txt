Location: Santa Ana high school auditorium

Description:
about 7 years ago a girl fell from a balcony in the auditorium during a play. Whenever there is a play, a dim light can be seen from the balcony above the stage itself. Dressing room doors close by themselves and there are cold spots. Its a tradition that we bring her spirit flowers before every play for a safe performance.
