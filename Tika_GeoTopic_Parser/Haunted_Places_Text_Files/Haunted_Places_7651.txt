Location: Lindenshire Trailer Park

Description:
There is an old pilot who said there used to be a graveyard on the land where the trailer park now rests. On the eastern half of the trailer park, there have been ghost sightings and other weird occurrences. There was a bleeding light bulb, with real blood dripping from it, and there are reports of eyes floating in a nearby stretch of woods called the Hobo Jungle which there have also been reports of satanic activity in.
