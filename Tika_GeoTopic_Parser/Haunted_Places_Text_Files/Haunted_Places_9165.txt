Location: J.P. OSCAR MARTINEZ'S OFFICE â€“ The Old Department of Public Safety office

Description:
This was the old DPS office and several employees have witnessed a deceased DPS officer wandering around the building at all times. He turns lights, computers, etc. on/off; he slams doors shut; shuffles papers/files around; you can actually see the door knob turning (like someone on the other side trying to open the door) but there is no one in the other room; strange sensation of being watched and cold chills.
