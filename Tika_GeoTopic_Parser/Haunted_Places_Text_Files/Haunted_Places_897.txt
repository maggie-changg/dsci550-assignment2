Location: Carson Long Military Institute

Description:
There have been stories told by the students there that things in their rooms have been moved. One of the students claims to have seen his trunk being moved across the floor. There has also been sightings of two red circles resembling eyes being seen in the Chapel. And a year ago one of the instructors heard laughing coming from "The Maples" when no one was in there.
