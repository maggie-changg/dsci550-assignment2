Description:
Keller Dorm - This dorm was the site of a student's suicide years ago. He hanged himself in a stairwell. Perhaps related to that, and perhaps not, there are a couple of rooms (rumors are that they're near his old room, but then again others say that's not so) that have had some freaky things happen. In the early 1990s, this acted up the most. A student was repeatedly locked out of this room, and one night ran out screaming because the bed was occupied by someone who wasn't there. When he came back with the Residential Assistant, the door was locked and they both heard the whole room being trashed by poltergeist activity.
