Location: Haunted Tree

Description:
somewhere off of Highway 7 there is a tree where a man had hung his two daughters and then hung himself. It has been reported that late at night the branches will be pushed down and shoot up and shake like something had fallen off of them. - October 2007 Update: They tore the haunted tree down because too many people were trespassing on the site.
