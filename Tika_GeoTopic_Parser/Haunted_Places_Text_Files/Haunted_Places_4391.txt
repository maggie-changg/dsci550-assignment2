Location: Drew University

Description:
Great Hall - There are a lot of haunted places at Drew University, actually.  The Great Hall is a castle-like structure in the middle of campus where the teachers have their offices.  The upper floor is a long, red-carpeted room where religious services used to be held.  The room is wood paneled with carvings along the beams, a large fireplace, and paneled doors, which blend into the wall.  People have reported seeing faces in the ceiling carvings, the chandeliers swing sometimes for no reason, and people have also reported strange reflections of a man with round, gold spectacles in a mirror there.  Feelings of being pushed to leave have also been reported.
