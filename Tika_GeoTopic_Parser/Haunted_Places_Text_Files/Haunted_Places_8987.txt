Location: Transmountain Road

Description:
There have been many reports of a monk and his donkey walking this road, which runs through the Franklin Mountains of El Paso, causing many car accidents. It is said he is protecting a lost goldmine where Spanish missionaries had a large fortune. The University of Texas at El Paso confirms that this goldmine did in fact exist...but the archaeological department has had no luck in finding it.
