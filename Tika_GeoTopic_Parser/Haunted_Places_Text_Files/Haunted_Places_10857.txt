Description:
Helen Hunt falls - The falls now bear her name. Her grave is up a little higher in the mountains in a place called Gold Camp Road. On the average of 5 people die around the Gold Camp area each year. If you drive through the tunnels there, something freaky ALWAYS happens. Handprints on the car, voices in the tunnels, etc.
