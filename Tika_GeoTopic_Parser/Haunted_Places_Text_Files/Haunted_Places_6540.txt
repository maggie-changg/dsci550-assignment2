Description:
The "South Annex" - The South Annex now houses a Dental Office and the English Institute of Seattle Central Community College. In the past, it was the Burnley School of Art. There is a story that a young male student at Burnley committed suicide and since then his spirit has haunted the building; mostly moving objects -- pushing them off shelves, etc. Some folks have claimed to see his ghost.
