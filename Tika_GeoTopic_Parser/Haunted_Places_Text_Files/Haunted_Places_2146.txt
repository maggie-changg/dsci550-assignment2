Location: High School Stage

Description:
At the Ozark High School, the stage used for musicals and plays is supposed to be haunted by a student who longed to be in a production. The director never cast him, and the boy told the director that one day he would be on stage. He later moved from the district and soon died in a car wreck. They say about a week before production, things are misplaced and missing, but he never disturbs anything the nights of the production.
