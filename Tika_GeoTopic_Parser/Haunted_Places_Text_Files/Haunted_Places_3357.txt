Location: Veteran's Lake

Description:
Near Chikasaw National Recreational area there is a small, well kept public lake. Stories vary regarding the origination of the haunting. One story concerns a young mother. She looked away for a moment and her son had gone under.....he never re-surfaced. The mother died in an attempt to rescue him. It is said that on certain nights she can be seen gliding upon the lake's surface. Some even say that she tries to lure unsuspecting lake-goers into the water either in an innocent attempt to help find her son or for other, more malicious purposes, depending on which version of the story you choose to believe. There was also a teenage girl who died in a boating accident on the lake a few years ago....some credit her as the ghost of Veteran's Lake. Whatever one chooses to believe, this is a beautiful, if eerie, location by the light of day.....and the peculiar feeling of unease only increases by night.
