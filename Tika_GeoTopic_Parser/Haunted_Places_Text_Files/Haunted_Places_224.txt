Location: Walgreen’s

Description:
Formerly The Brass Lantern Restaurant - The Brass Inn is a very expensive restaurant. It has a bar as well, in the smoking section. The bar is haunted. Witness have seen a guy sitting in stool #2 from the left (NOT from the bar tenders point of view). Then he disappears. Sometimes there is a VERY EERIE feeling when you walk over to the bar. - March 2008 Update: Nothing has been reported since it was replaced by Walgreen’s.
