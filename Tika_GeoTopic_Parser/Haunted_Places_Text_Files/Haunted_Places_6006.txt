Location: Bowdoin Park/ old Haunted Mansion site

Description:
Believed to be haunted by Sigfried who was a prisoner of war in a war camp that was on that spot. He was put to work in the kitchen and killed himself by putting himself in the oven. There is also a tree just outside of the building that was used to hang Indians and you can feel them when you touch it. In the attic, which was used as a makeup room, people have seen a telescope floating as if someone is looking for ships. There are also other parts of the park that are haunted.
