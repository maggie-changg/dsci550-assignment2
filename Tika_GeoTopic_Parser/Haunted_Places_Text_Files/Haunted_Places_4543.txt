Location: Custer House boardwalk

Description:
The spirit of the wives of the soldiers who were killed in the battle of the Little Big Horn remain here. On occaision a terrible moaning and wailing cry comes from a spot on the boardwalk just to the south side of the Custer mansion. It is followed by a rushing wind-like energy that shoots upward from the ground. Lights appear at night in the downstairs and upstairs windows.
