Location: Railroad tracks

Description:
Legend has it that a conductor was walking down the tracks holding a lantern when a train passed by. A chain was hanging off of the train and t decapitated the man. Supposedly you can see the lantern swinging back and forth going up and down the tracks searching for his head. Also, if you look up in the trees, you can see a white light hiding in the trees. I've seen a black figure on the side of the tracks that comes toward the car from the left and it will cross the tracks and you can see it go toward to the other end of town. Sometimes the thing will follow you to Churchville road and ten turn around. There has also been a sighting of the old day train cars that took 2 people to move. The cars that look like they have a seesaw, which moves the train car.
