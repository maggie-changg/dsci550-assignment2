Description:
Merriam Hall - The ghost of a man in army clothing wanders the halls of Merriam, a dormitory. He is known for sitting in the bathroom stall next to yours late at night. Many have reported seeing boots in the next stall when in fact; there was no one in there but them. At night, when some girls are brushing their hair in the mirror, they see the reflection of a man wearing army clothing.
