Location: Waikiki Parc Hotel

Description:
A worker who recently passed away apparently has been punching in for work. His magnetic punch card has been cancelled, yet the machine still records someone punching in with his card. This has happened on more than one occasion. Strangely, the records only show him punching in. Never punching out.
