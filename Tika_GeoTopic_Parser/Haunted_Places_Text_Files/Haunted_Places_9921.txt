Location: Wentworth Military Academy

Description:
Scholastic BuildingThe dark room in the downstairs of the Scholastic Building is boarded up to this day because of a student who committed suicide by hanging himself there back when hazing was perfectly legal. - April 2007 Additional information - it is said that lights in the top right floor near the lab would come on all by themselves even after rounds have been made, and the building was secure, and locked. When it was investigated, there was nothing there, and the lights would be off. Also footsteps would be heard in the night when rounds were being made to make sure the building was secure. If you were on the bottom floor, you could hear footsteps on the second floor. The library there was home to a civil war officer who would protect it.
