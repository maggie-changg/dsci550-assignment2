Location: University of Pittsburgh

Description:
Laurel Hall & Oak Hall,  Oak Hall and Laurel Halls as well as the woods surrounding the campus all have had strange happenings. Oak and Laurel were supposedly built on an Indian burial ground; the stretch between the two scares some people so much that they will not walk it at night; drums have been heard around here. Laurel was exercised in 1986 after a knife flew across the room and stuck in the a door by itself. In the woods there is a small cemetery and a ghost of a small girl has been seen walking around its vicinity.
