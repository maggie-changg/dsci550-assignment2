Location: Crybaby Bridge

Description:
One day long ago a baby had drowned while parents were picnicking. It is said that if you drive over Crybaby Bridge at night you can hear a baby crying. The bridge is torn down now, but still if you go to the site of crybaby bridge you can still feel something in the air and a faint noise either coming from the woods or below where the bridge once stood.
