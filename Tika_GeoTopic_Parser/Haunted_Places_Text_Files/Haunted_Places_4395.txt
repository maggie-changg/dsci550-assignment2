Location: Woodlawn Park

Description:
A few years ago a 16 year old girl was found dead in Woodlawn Park. Apparently she committed suicide because of a bad break up with her boyfriend. It is said if you go to the park and call for her one time, the swing will start swinging violently and come to a complete stop suddenly. Reports of hearing a poem in your head.
