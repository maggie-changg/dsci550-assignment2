Location: Gravity Hill

Description:
This legendary hill is easily reached from Bonaire if you follow State Route 96 East across the Ocmulgee River to the intersection of US Route 129. Once you have turned left and passed over the first hill, go to the next hill bottom and stop. Put your car in neutral and it will go all the way to the top of the next hill. It is said that a witch is buried around there. The only evidence of her grave is located in the swamp, about 300 yards from Highway 129. It is a strange pile of rocks stacked about 5 feet high with nothing growing around it. Legend has it that the witch exacted a toll on this trail about 200 years ago. If you paid her price, she would help you cross over the ridges. The locals left her alone and occasionally called upon her during a drought. The witch died of natural causes around 1850. Since she could not be buried on holy ground in a church cemetery, the locals took her body to the swamp. It is believed that she helps people over the ridge because of the kindness the local people showed to her.
