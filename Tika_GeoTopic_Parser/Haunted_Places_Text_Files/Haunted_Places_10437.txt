Location: Lake Alimagnet Trails

Description:
sightings of a figure who seems to look like a clown have been reported. The clown does not seem to be harmful, but stares at you. The only intent is to scare you away from the wooded trails. Sightings have been reported mostly at dust, just as the sun sets.
