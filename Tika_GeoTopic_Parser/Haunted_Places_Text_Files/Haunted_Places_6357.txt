Location: Johnson Gym University of New Mexico

Description:
While in the facility at night after closing, there is a strong presence and a feeling of being followed and watched. Also, shadows appear in the corner of the eye, and then immediately disappear if looked at directly. Rumor (urban legend?) has it that a murder took place many years ago, or that a student hung herself in one of the locker rooms.
