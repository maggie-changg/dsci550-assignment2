Location: C.E. Byrd High School

Description:
This school (built in 1925) had a swimming pool at one time, but the pool was closed because a teenage girl supposedly drowned in it. A dance studio was built above it. In the "catacombs"(subbasement) of the school, a JROTC instructor reportedly killed himself with a rifle and his ghost still haunts the school to this day. Cold Spots reported.
