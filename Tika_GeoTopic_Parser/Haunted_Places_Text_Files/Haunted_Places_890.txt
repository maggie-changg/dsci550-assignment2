Location: Kmart

Description:
2 overnight employees, each in a different part of the store, saw the ghostly image of a woman in a long flowing white dress. On one occasion, she even called out the name of David {one of the employees}, repeating the name twice in a haunting manner. On other occasions, feminine products were knocked off the shelves when no one was around. Magnetic signs fell from the ceiling, previously folded clothing was found in disarray, among other strange happenings.
