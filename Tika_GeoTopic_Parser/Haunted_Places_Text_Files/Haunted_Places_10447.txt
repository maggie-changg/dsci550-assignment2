Location: Sturges Park

Description:
The old bathroom is reportedly the sight of a lot of paranormal activity. Names written in blood on the mirror. Strange balls of light floating in and out. Old man Sturges, a wealthy businessman of Buffalo in the 1880s is seen occasionally wandering through his old house, which is right next to the park.
