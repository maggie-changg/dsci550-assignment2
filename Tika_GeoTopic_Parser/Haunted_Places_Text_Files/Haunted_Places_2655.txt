Location: North Star Mine Lodge

Description:
Was converted into a Christian boarding school in the 1960's. It was shut down in the mid 80's. Doors opened and closed by themselves drastic temperature changes pictures flew off walls windows opening and shutting these events were witnessed by quite a few of the other students often by groups of us at one time the temperature changes and things flying off the walls seem to occur at the same time. - September 2004 update: Someone has bought this lodge and is planning to restore it and open it as a lodge again, but it is heavily guarded now and its not a good idea to go up there anymore.
