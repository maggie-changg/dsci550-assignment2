Location: Eagle River

Description:
Long ago, in the 1800's, a man worked on the railroad tracks. One day, he was on a caboose, in the back, and he fell off. He was knocked unconscious, and another train was coming. He was decapitated; his head flew 200 feet away. To this day, he uses his old railroad light, searching for his lost head.
