Location: Mokuleia Beach Park

Description:
Reports that the Night Marchers have been seen there. Also, seen once, a rectangle of light as if from a window with the silhouette of a man sitting on a boulder outside of the first cabin across an empty field from the cafeteria. There is no boulder next to the cabin, just the empty field.
