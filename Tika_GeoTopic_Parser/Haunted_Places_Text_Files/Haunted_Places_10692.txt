Location: NHC

Description:
NHC is a care facility for the elderly. So apparently many of elderly folks have passed away at this facility. One night while workers were on night shift one of the staff saw a ghostly white woman that had just passed away the night before walking down the hall in a white gown. She kept quiet thinking the nurses would think differently of her until the nurse went in her old room to give her roommate her meds and went to throw the cups in the trash and the trash can moved half way across the room. Then she went back to the nurse's desk in half a breath and saw her coming down the hall. The nurse then decided to ask the aide if she saw that and the aide decided to tell her what happened 10min. before that. They insisted on warning the morning staff when they arrived.
