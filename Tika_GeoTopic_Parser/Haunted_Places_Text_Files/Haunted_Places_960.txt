Location: Pine Grove Furnace

Description:
Go all the way back Old Shippensburg Rd (across from road to furnace).  The Appalachian Trail is back here not to far from the parking area. There have been several occurrences involving loud noises from above, sort of like a helicopter, loud enough that you can't hear the person next to you talk.  There is also a patch of thick pine trees off the trail not too far from the parking area. Inside there are 2 large stones 75% buried in the ground across from a headstone type object.  This whole area is open and is about 10' by 10'.  If you carry a propane lantern or flashlight into the opening it will go out and lighters will not light. You can still hear the gas from the lantern but it will not light until you leave the opening.  You can always hear various strange noises coming from the woods as soon as the sun goes down.
