Location: Liberty Baptist Church/Cemetery

Description:
Throughout the years, there have been mysterious lights in the cemetery. Also, an old woman can be seen, usually during the summer months, in a rocking chair in the upstairs window. The gravel road in front of Liberty is also rumored to be haunted by a young woman who had been killed in the early 1900's. A little boy has also been seen in the cemetery and is seen in pictures that had been shot in the cemetery. Lights turn on and off mysteriously in the church.
