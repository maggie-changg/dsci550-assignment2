Location: The Safety Harbor Spa Resort

Description:
Several housekeepers tell of hearing their name called from the woman's bath area of the spa-and nobody is there. During a renovation in the mid-90's, the front desk would receive phone calls from empty guestrooms in the dead of night. When security would investigate, they could hear voices in the totally empty building.
