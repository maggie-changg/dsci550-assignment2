Location: Hopewell cemetery

Description:
the light- Near oxford their is a place called hueston woods, go through it until you find the Hopewell cemetery. It is one of the best ghost hunting sites in southern Ohio. And I saw the light in oxford also mentioned on here, if you want to be safe don't go to it. It has caused me very bad luck every time I go near it. But up the street from it their is a barn you can't miss it, go their and search around, when you get back to your car their will be a little surprise. I went once and haven't ever been back the surprise caused us to wreck the car we were in trying to get away.
