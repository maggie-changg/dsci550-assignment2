Location: Pettit Lane

Description:
There's a field on the right side of the road. Collin's Field. If someone drives by at Midnight when there's a full moon it is said, that there is a ghost of a slave that once worked that field who murdered his owner's daughter. He can be seen walking along waving around a pitchfork looking for his next victim.
