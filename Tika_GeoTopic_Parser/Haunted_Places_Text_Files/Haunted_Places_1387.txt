Location: Bridgewater State College

Description:
one of the bathrooms on the second floor is haunted. a girl hung herself. now if someone is in the bathroom alone they hear a noise of a girl choking. also the noise of a shower. when the shower isn't even on. Another thing that happens sometimes if you take a shower in there and you are alone in the bathroom all the showers turn on by themselves. another place that is haunted is the stairway. sometimes we see black object moving. they aren't shadows from other things because you see it when its darker.
