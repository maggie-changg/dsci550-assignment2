Location: Church of the Holy Cross- Dalzell, North 261

Description:
Church Cemetery is haunted by a Confederate Soldier that apparently had an untimely death. Eyewitnesses see him strolling through the cemetery, and disappearing before they can approach him. There has also been a woman sitting in a low-lying tree, with her legs crossed. This is a genuinely haunted cemetery.
