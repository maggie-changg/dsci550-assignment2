Location: Nacoochee Methodist Church

Description:
The cemetery beside the church is supposed to be haunted. There's a grave a young girl there, and her father built a dollhouse over her grave to protect her from the rain. They say the man who killed her was hanged on the property. They say if you stand beside her grave long enough you can hear her crying.
