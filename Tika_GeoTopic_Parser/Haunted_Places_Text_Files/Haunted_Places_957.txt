Location: Historical Seven Stars Inn

Description:
There are several spirits that have been sited on the grounds. The spirit of a young boy has been seen in an upstairs dinning room (formerly a guest room of the inn). The spirit of a middle age man has been seen on several occasions, always looking down the second floor stair well. He is believed to be a former owner who in his old age had fallen to his death in this stair well while supervising the cleaning ladies. The most prominent spirit is that of a woman who had hung her self in the third floor attic.
