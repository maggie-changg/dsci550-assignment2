Location: Mirror Lake

Description:
There is a ghost of a jogger who was killed there. If you sit on the east side and face west a cold breeze comes through and the lake goes perfectly calm and then on the northwest side you see the apparition of a spirit in a jogging suit who keeps turning around as though he was followed.
