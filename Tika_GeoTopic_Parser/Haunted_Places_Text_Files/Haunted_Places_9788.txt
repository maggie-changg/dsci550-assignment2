Location: South East Missouri State University

Description:
The Music building  - Lights and shadows have been seen, and doors have been heard slamming as well. Witnesses have seen figures walking down the hall that dissolved when they got close; and heard doors slamming hard as though they had been slung against the door frame. Investigation proved all doors locked and because of how the building is built and situated, it is easy to tell if someone else in the building.
