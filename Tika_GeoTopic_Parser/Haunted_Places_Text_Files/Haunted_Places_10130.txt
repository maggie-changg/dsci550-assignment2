Location: Villa Theresa Guest House

Description:
This historic inn has a very colorful past. The scent of perfume lingers around the upstairs dormer rooms. Visions have been seen at the main staircase. The spirit of a girl by the name of Giselle happily roams the household. A very inviting and non-threatening mystery.
