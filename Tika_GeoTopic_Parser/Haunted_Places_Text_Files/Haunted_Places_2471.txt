Location: Cherokee Cemetery

Description:
It is history that the town sweetheart was murdered in the 1800 and her murderer burned alive in his home across the street from the cemetery. If you visit the cemetery during the evening hours, you can hear stomping in this extremely deserted area. Also there grave of a child that passed the same day as his father. If you place flowers on that tombstone, locals say he will visit you that evening and thank you.
