Location: Old House

Description:
There is an old house across from a bar in Lockport. It was a house that was involved in keeping slaves during the Civil War and was part of the underground railroad. There was a massacre there, where everyone was killed. A few years ago someone bought it to restore and make into a museum but the men rebuilding it kept getting very scared by ghostly presences on the site and in the house. They left their scaffolding there and never came back. If you go near the house at night you can see black figures guarding it.
