Description:
Central Pattee Library -  Odd feelings of a presence and being watched felt by students on top floor of central Pattee (Murder of librarian years ago?) - January 2004 update/ correction - the #1 ranked haunted place at Penn State, Pattee Library was the site of a murder in 1969. A girl named Betsy (a student employee) was found dead on the first basement level. As spooky as that is, though, most of the ghostly events that happen in the Library aren't related to her at all. Workers and Students report that there have been strange screams echoing up from the basement levels, transparent girls thumbing through books, disembodied glowing red eyes, book carts being moved without anyone present, and all sorts of other phenomena.
