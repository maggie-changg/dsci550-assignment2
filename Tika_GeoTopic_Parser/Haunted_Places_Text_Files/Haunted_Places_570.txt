Description:
Alpha Sigma Tau Sorority House - The story goes that when this house was an estate, the maidservant, Alicia, got pregnant from the owner of the house. When he discovered her pregnancy, he threw her down the stairs (which no longer exist, although remnants can be seen in an upstairs closet) running from the attic to the kitchen. Alicia still haunts the house to this day. Noises have been heard throughout the house, the attic light, where Alicia lived,Â mysteriously goes on and off. The attic is just storage currently. Bedroom lights go on and off unexpectedly. Pictures of men are often turned around or covered. One sister had a male friend visit overnight. During the night, she was awoken by the bed shaking only to see him fast asleep. She also felt cold air in her ear and no one was there nor any window. Possibly unrelated to Alicia, one fish tank would leak in every room except when placed in the middle living room. A few years ago, several boys tried to spend the night in the attic at 2am they ran out screaming and never explained what terrified them. They refused to return to the house.
