Location: South County Museum

Description:
Figures seen walking from room to room in the main office building (that was once and old farm house).  Creepy feeling in the basement of the museum hall.  Things reported being moved overnight in the museum hall by the only person who had the key.  A former employee reported seeing a full apparition outside via the reflection on a computer monitor.  The apparition was thought to be a real person that was coming into the office...no one came in, and no one was in the parking lot. The "person" was reported to have been wearing early 1900's garb, plaid/pastel blazer with kakis, a tan round flat straw/wicker? hat, with a matching breif case.  The museum is located where the beach house/mansion of former Governor Sprague used to be.  And very close to Narragansett town beach, the "it" beach to be in victorian times."
