Location: Galaxy Club

Description:
Late at night near the juice bar of the club, you can hear over the loud music people calling your name. There is a air hockey game in the back of the club and when nobody is playing it you can hear the puck move across the board and hitting the paddles. After the club closes and all the lights are off, you hear loud crashing noises. But when you go to look, nothing has fallen. You even can see orbs of light moving fast through the darkness of the club. - October 2005 Update: A couple years ago this was leveled and made into a parking lot.
