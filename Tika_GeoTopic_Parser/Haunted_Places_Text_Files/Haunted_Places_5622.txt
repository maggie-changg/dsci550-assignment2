Location: Plum Point Condos

Description:
The story goes... There is a rather large building, in which is now know Plum Point condo's, in Newburgh NY that used to be a all boys Christian school. One of the nun's molested the boy & killed him then put his body in the wall and covered it up well (being there was already construction going on inside it was a good cover-up, he was just reported missing) Then about a year later strange things would happen that drove the school to shut down. For about 10 or more years now they have been trying to make it into an apartment complex because there are condo's all around it, and every time someone goes in there to work, a hand was cut off by machinery, the machinery would break for no apparent reason, etc.. And many people have said they have seen the boy. - October 2005 Correction: The above submission is the "popular word about town" regarding the information on our site, however, most of it is not true. Unfortunately, this same description regarding Plum Point on many websites. Probably cutting and pasting from this site. A visitor to our site reports the following: "Before the condos went in, there was a large mansion (complete with detached servant's quarters.) It was originally constructed for a family who met an untimely death. The mansion then became a home for wayward girls for many years and eventually an orphanage of sorts, accepting children who were not only parentless, but had no where to run. This is where the rumors of the molestation occurrence sprouts from. The molestation may be true, but in all my research and hearing of rumors, I have never heard a report of anyone being buried in the walls.
