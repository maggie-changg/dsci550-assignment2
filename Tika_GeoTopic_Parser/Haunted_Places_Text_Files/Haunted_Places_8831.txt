Description:
Pressor Hall - The ghost of a girl who was killed by her boyfriend haunts this University. The top floor has been converted to storage due to unexplainable events like hearing a piano, elevator doors closing and opening, and the sound of footsteps. A campus police officer only locks the building from the outside because of the phenomena he witnessed here.
