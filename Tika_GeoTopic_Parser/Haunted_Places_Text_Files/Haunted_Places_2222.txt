Location: Outpost Village Resort RV &amp; Mobile Home Park

Description:
Former landlord shot and killed a man in the Jacuzzi over a betting debt. The Jacuzzi and house were burned down by the local fire department in 1998. People report seeing a ghostly figure wandering around the property. The former property manager (me) had to do a spirit releasement on some of the tenants and friends living in the resort.
