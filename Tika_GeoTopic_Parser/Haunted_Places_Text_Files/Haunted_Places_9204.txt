Description:
Many years ago a little girl was killed by a drunk driver while searching for her missing dog. When going down this road late at night, and turning off your lights, your car will accelerate without even pushing the gas. And you can even see lights and a car braking in front of you. If your lucky you can still see a little girl searching with her flashlight.
