Description:
June 2008 hoax - No information pertaining to a girl being dragged by a car can be found anywhere in Detroit. In Gross Isle there is a lovers' lane. The story goes that one night a man and a girl were there and the girl wouldn't do anything with the guy so the guy kicked her out of the car and slammed the door. Her hair supposedly got caught in the door and it is said that he dragged her down the road several miles. If you go down the street that she was dragged on you can her a knocking on the side of your car many times as if she was caught on the side of your car. - February 2004 Correction: The road was never called "Knock Knock" but the story is true and it is in the archives of the Detroit news, dated June 12th 1962, the girl was a babysitter that got caught up in and taken by the man of the house and when she refused his advances he kicked her out of his car but it was her dress not her hair and she was dragged to her death.
