Location: Albertus Magnus College

Description:
Dominican Hall -  the former Yale Psychiatric Institution. Activities reported are knocking on walls, stereos and televisions being turned on or off (especially when there is a lot of noise, or the music is too loud), doors slamming and people running through hallways when no one is there, and voices muttering. Spirits appear in pictures, too.
