Location: Eagle's Lounge and Rio theater

Description:
both right next to each other and part of one building more than 100 years old. The basement of the Eagle's Lounge was a mortuary and the very top floor was once a ballroom many many years ago. Many people claim that very strange things happen in both the theater and the ballroom.
