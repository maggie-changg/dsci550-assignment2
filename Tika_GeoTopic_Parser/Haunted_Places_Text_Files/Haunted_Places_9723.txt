Location: Howard W. Blake High School

Description:
The site of Blake High school was a hospital many years ago. When walking in hallways, it will be normal temperature. Once in a classroom, especially in the E building(theater) or B building, temperature will drop drastically, even if the air conditioning is broken, giving you hospital conditions. It is believed by the students that the B building was where the mortuary was.
