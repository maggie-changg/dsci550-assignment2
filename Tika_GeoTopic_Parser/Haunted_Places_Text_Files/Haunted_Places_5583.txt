Location: (Lake Mills)

Description:
Aztalan State park - This is a very active spirit place. Many people have a very uneasy feeling here, like they are being stalked or hunted. Many divers have had strange things happen when they are in the area of these mounds. There is a book out on the stories of the divers who looked for the pyramids on the bottom of the lake.
