Location: Mercer University

Description:
Boone Dormitory - On the top floor, one room is locked. The window has been covered so you cannot see into the room.  A young girl committed suicide for some reason.  Some pages to her journal were found.  But its cold up there and sometimes you can see a hanging apparition from outside in the center balcony.
