Location: Former Biloxi Regional Hospital

Description:
When an active hospital, dying patients would see young girls at the end of their beds. One time there was a sighting of a tall, white figure pass through the dispatcher area, which became extremely cold. Locked doors can be heard opening and slamming shut during the night.
