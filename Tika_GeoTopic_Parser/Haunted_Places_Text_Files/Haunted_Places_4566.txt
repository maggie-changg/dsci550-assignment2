Location: Ivy House Inn B&amp;B

Description:
There is a spirit of a man, who sets off the alarms in the parking lot where a house used to be. There is a lady, a former owner , who goes from room to room. Small catlike animals run down the halls and up the stairs from time to time. There are cold spots in the house. Items have eerily moved. The original 1916 house had a traveling cloud in the sitting room, but after it was torn down for parking, any car parked where the sitting room now sounds off when set, usually after 2:30 am and late in the morning. Many pictures in the house with anomalies or vortices have been taken.
