Location: Eastern University

Description:
Doane Residence Hall - (which used to be part of the servants quarters back when the University was an estate) is haunted by a girl who hung herself on the second floor in one of the dorm rooms. Reports are, if you place a chair in the room and shut out the lights and close the door, the chair will fall over and you can hear a female gasping for air.
