Location: Manget-Brannon Theater for the Arts

Description:
Theater is housed in what was once a warehouse, probably for cotton, which was abandoned for years until it was inhabited by the theater company. Volunteers and actors have felt a distinct presence, many of them collaborating on one particular area on the floor on the way to the bathroom. Several have believed the presence to be distinctively male. A psychic visited there last year and said she saw a man wearing a suit walk through one of the doors. She later saw him standing in a particular corner of the stage. He has been blamed with man petty prop disappearances.
