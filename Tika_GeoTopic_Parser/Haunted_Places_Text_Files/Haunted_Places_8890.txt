Location: The Devil's Backbone

Description:
Ghosts of Monks and Native Americans have been seen. At one time a large group of riders who looked liked civil war soldiers rode by a group of men. There cabin shook from the force of the horse's hoofs hitting the ground. When they had passed no one plant had been damaged.
