Description:
Berrymen Service Station - Closed late 80s.around 1993 our church was holding a yard sale close to the service station. Two girls walking by the place stopped to talk with our group. They was around the side of the building, they said it sounded like something moved in side. me and my friend went to look. No one was inside as far as we could see. the place was locked solid. No windows were busted out. Another witness said that he and a friend walked by the building. It was getting dark, and they were walking by. They heard walking inside. They went to investigate & it was locked up. No way any one got in. then a strange glow was seen in the corner. It floated. He said both ran, and did not look back.
