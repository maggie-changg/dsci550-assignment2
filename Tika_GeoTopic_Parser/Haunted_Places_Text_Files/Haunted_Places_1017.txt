Description:
Smith Hall - There was a girl that killed herself on the 1st floor in Smith Hall. Students have heard footsteps in the hall but no one was there. Someone used dowsing rods (to detect spiritual activity) on the 1st floor and they crossed in front of the girl's room, which she killed herself in.
