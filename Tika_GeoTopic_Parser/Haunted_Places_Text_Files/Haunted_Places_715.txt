Description:
Glatfelter Hall - The bell tower on Glatfelter Hall is haunted by the spirit of a girl that committed suicide by jumping from the tower. Male faculty members and students have seen her at the top of the tower late at night. The story is that her lover was supposed to jump with her, but after she jumped he changed his mind. So, late at night she tries to lure the men walking by up to the top, hoping they will jump to their death and join her.
