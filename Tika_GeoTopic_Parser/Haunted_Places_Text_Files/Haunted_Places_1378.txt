Location: Charlesgate

Description:
Originally a hotel of ill repute, then a dorm for Emerson College, is currently selling condos. Haunted by persistent flappers, drug-addicted dandies, and an old man with a beard. Parapsychologists filmed ghostly horses in lower basement, which once served as the stables.
