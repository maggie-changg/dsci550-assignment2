Location: Mount Hope Cemetery

Description:
May 2008 Update â€“ The Statue of Jesus to even exist is questionable. - At Mount Hope Cemetery in North Attleboro, there exists a haunted statue of Jesus that supposedly, if you stare at from afar, it begins to perform humorous dance moves! The statue is easy to locate. It is a white statue, and it has both arms raised into the air, with it's feet covered by bushes. We have actually investigated this claim, and surprisingly, found it to be true!
