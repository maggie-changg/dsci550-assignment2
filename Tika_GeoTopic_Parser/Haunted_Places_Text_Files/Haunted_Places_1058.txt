Location: Hoot Rd/Main St.

Description:
The sound of a man's footsteps in the attic of this early Victorian period house (built circa 1836) has been reported by many of it's past residents, along with mysterious voices. The home has been said to have been renovated around 1880, and again around 1930. It is rumored, but not confirmed, that this was the home of a Civil War soldier who was killed in battle and returns to his home looking for his family. This same soldier has also been seen at night guarding the Sonestown Covered Bridge.
