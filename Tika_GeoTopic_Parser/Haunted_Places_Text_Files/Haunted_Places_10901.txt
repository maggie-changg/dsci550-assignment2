Location: The Pratt Hotel

Description:
This Bed and Breakfast was built in the late 19th century and is haunted by the first owner's daughter, Millie Pratt, who fell down the very steep front stairway. She only seems to appear to women. Her room is the one by the top of the stairs. She whispers "mother!" in women's' ears at night and several have seen her fall down the stairs or lying at the bottom of the staircase.
