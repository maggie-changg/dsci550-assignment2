Location: Crystal Hot Springs

Description:
A former worker/student reports to have heard and seen several strange noises and images.  The main building houses three different floors.  The second floor was called the blue room and used for hosting parties.  Several employees have heard doors shut and heard foot steps above on the third floor.  A silhouette walking in front of a computer screen that was always left on has been seen from outside after it was closed up.  There were many other strange stories from other employees as well;  feelings of an evil presence, shadows where there should be none, doors opening and closing and footsteps in upper floors.
