Location: Fairmont Apartments

Description:
One of the complexes at the Fairmont Apartments is haunted for unknown reasons. Many of the people living there in the past have reported hearing constant footsteps around the place at all hours. Other people have been asleep in their beds and have had the covers pulled off of their beds in the middle of the night by unseen forces. Out of all the apartments in this complex apartment 6 is believed to have the highest spiritual energies. The people that once lived in this apartment were haunted by many spirits and reported hearing their names like "the wind blowing" at late hours. Another report about this apartment was when a woman was sitting in the living room watching the TV, the room grew very cold and the numbers on the TV began to change, however the TV remained on one channel. Then shortly after she reported seeing footprints appearing in the carpet as if someone was walking across the room. Also the showers have been reported to come on by themselves.
