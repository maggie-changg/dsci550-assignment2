Location: Grayson Manor

Description:
The house of General Grayson is a very hot topic in Marion County. General Grayson still walks through the halls and room upstairs. He was a doctor during the civil war. It is said that he went crazy and stabbed his wife and his children to death. While standing downstairs you can sometimes hear footsteps in the bedroom upstairs (where General Grayson hung himself after he murdered his family), and then you hear a loud thud and then a creaking sound as if you hear him swinging from the rafter.
