Location: Witch's grave

Description:
There is a grave of a so-called-witch hidden in the back of a cemetery on a tall hill north of the town. People have stayed there overnight to see if it was haunted just to hear weird sounds like mumbling and sometimes see a strange figure walking around just to disappear next to a tree.
