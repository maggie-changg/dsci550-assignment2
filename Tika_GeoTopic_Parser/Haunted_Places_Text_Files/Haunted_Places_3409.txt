Location: Bucksport Cemetery

Description:
The grave of Jonathon Buck has a footprint cracked into the tombstone. The tombstone has been replaced many times but the foot always reappears a short time later. Jonathon Buck ordered the death of his mistress, claiming she was a witch. She promised to return and dance on his grave. It is believed to be her foot (and leg) that continues to appear on the tombstone.
