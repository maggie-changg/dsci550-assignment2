Description:
The Adair House - There is a little girl that many people have seen on the property and she is usually seen in the Adair house and turns the lights in the attic on and off. The employees have left toys in the attic and they will be in one spot when they leave that day and when they return the next morning they will be moved. Many employees have reported seeing a figure matching the description of Godfrey Barnsley in the cottages at night, he was the owner of the property in the 1800's. - The property is patrolled by security at night and any chance of investigating would have to be approved by the people at Barnsley.
