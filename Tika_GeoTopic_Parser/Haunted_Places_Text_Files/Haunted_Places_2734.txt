Description:
when going back sometimes you can hear voices yelling. some foot prints of animals that have 7 claws, and loud whooshing noises when getting close to the hills, but goes away when u get a little bit farther away, creatures that move incredibly fast and make high pitched growls, with spikes on their backs and dark clouds gather above and follow you back to estelli. you get feelings of fear and the feeling your not welcomed
