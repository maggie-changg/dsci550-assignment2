Location: Jefferson Middle School

Description:
Jefferson Middle School used to be known as Jefferson High School a few years back, and once a basketball player was on her way to a school dance, and she was killed in a car crash. Coaches and gym teaches have sworn to hear basketballs bouncing while alone, grading papers, in the gymnasium.
