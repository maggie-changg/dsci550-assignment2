Description:
Used to be a Library - Haunted by old Librarian who ate a whole bar of Lye soap in the basement over a love affair. She has been seen often at night in the windows looking out, and when it was a library she used to knock books over with a violent push. The basement is now rarely used and only during the day by employees.
