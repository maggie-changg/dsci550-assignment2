Location: Camp Both in

Description:
It used to be an Indian reservation, then early in the 1920s, became a hospital for tuberculosis patients. Now it is used as a Girl Scout camp, but it still has the original sinks from the hospital. You can hear a ghost of a nurse pushing her cart up and down the halls, moaning, screaming, appearances and disappearances and some ancient Indians spirits too.
