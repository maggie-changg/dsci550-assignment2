Location: The Lula Trestle

Description:
A ghost of a woman who was murdered on the tracks is seen hovering over the tracks. The train that hit her is sometimes seen. If a group of people walk down the tracks at night, and take count at the trestle there is usually one more person with them. The sight is now under video surveillance since there have been several mysterious deaths on the trestle.
