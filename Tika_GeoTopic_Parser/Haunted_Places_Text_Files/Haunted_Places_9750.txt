Location: Alabama Hotel

Description:
Built when Winter Park was founded, several guests were murdered on opening night. They have been seen walking the halls and blamed for murders that occurred in the fifties. It has been abandoned until 1998, when it was converted into a personal mansion. - February 2007 Update / Correction: The Alabama isn't now nor never was a private mansion. It was a seasonal hotel, only open during the winter, then it was closed for a time, then in the '70s it was converted to retirement condominiums.
