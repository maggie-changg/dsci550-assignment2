Description:
October 2004 UPDATE: This is now private property. NO TRESPASSING - around the 1950s a servant was taking a bath when her radio fell in and killed her. also, prior to that event, a murder was committed inside the estate. footsteps can be heard inside house, along with lights and faces in the windows on several accounts during the late evening to early morning.
