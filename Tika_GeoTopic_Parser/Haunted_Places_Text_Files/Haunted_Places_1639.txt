Location: Fuddruckerâ€™s Restaurant

Description:
Formerly listed as Blockbuster Video - most employees from the Blockbuster have witnessed this entity. It seems to be male and has a desire to make contact with the living. After closing, he will activate battery operated toys that are sold in the store, open and close the locked bathroom door, turn the lights off and on and then off again, and most frightening of all, he speaks to the employees through the store sound system. When all trailer tapes have stopped running and the satellite TV display has been shut off, the ghost has been known to say things such as... "shh... listen," and "you've been bad..." Another incident that took place was after midnight when a manager and another employee went into the office momentarily only to return finding over thirty-movie cover boxes stacked neatly on top of each other in the floor. This scared both people so much that they didn't investigate until the next day. The boxes were stacked in a corner of the store that the security cameras had no coverage of, so their story to their co-workers the next day was not taken seriously. - June 2008 Update/Additional Information: The Blockbuster Video was demolished last year and is now a Fuddrucker's restaurant. before Blockbuster Video was on that site, the land was home to a Beno's department store and a skate park. In the early 1980's, a young boy broke his neck at the skate park and died from his injuries. This could be related to the "haunting" of the site.
