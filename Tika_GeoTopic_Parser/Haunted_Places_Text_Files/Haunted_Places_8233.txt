Location: Target

Description:
There was a Target Dept. store under construction, when the police were chasing someone that had gotten away from them. He climbed up on the upper beams of the structure trying to get away, and fell to his death. Everyone that has ever worked there has said that it gets strangely cold even during the summer in the stock room. They also say that you can hear running footsteps but there would be no one back there. You can hear things falling but nothing actually did. In the front of the store in the offices, strange smells will occur.
