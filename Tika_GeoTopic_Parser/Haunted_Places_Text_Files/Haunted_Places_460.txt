Location: Pardee road. The woods "Farmous Feild".

Description:
The woods back behind Birch street. On Pardee. Is known that if you go back there. You will see Blown up cars. There is a mini van. That got blown up. And in the mini van about 4 or 5 years ago. Was a family sleeping. Some one shot the single mom in the back of her neck. But there were still 3 kids in the back of the van still sleeping. The car was on the street Birch. In front of a house. The house is 4 house's down from the baseball diamond. On the left side. So They say if a Mini Van parks there and you stay in it all night a guy will show up in all black with a gun. And disappear. The guy stole the single moms car and then blown it up. With the kids still in the back sleeping. So be careful going back in the Senders and walking in to the darkness of Famous Feild.
