Maintenance workers, Security officers, Secretaries and residents (prisoners) have reported seeing and unknown old Man in coveralls in different parts of the building or on the grounds outside.  Also a young girl has been spotted in the basement near what was once the morgue. Smoking is not permitted in the building but usually after spotting the old man the smell of cigar or pipe smoke is noticed. A private security firm patrols this building 24 hours a day. Sometimes after a weekend where their office doors are locked secretaries will return to find old pennies laying in plain sight on their desks or inside of locked desk drawers or on the seats of their chairs. But mostly lights in will come on at night in offices that are locked and extremely cold drafts are felt on the warmest of nights.
