Location: cry baby bridge

Description:
Possible Urban Legend - There was a family driving across the bridge only that lived in the 1800. They were carriage driving across the bridge. Another carriage ran right into them. The baby fell out and drown. Now if you go across the bridge at night and turn you car off you hear the baby crying. Also if you stay long a blue green small fog will float were it drown and come close to you car.
