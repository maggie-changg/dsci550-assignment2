Location: Shotwell Covered Bridge

Description:
A woman and her two children were in a car wreck when the bridge they were crossing over gave way, and the car fell into the ravine. The wreck killed all three. It is said that if you put candy on the side of the bridge at dusk and turn your headlights on, you can see the children get the candy off of the bridge.
