Location: Veterans Park

Description:
Place is known to be haunted by a man name Martin who once worked as janitor at this park. People have claimed to talked to a Martin when they have called the park office before it has even opened. Lights go off and on for no reason doors will open and close and the radio will change on its own to a local Spanish station.
