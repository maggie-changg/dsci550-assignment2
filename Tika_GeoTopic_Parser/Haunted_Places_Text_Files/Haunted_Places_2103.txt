Location: Tinsman

Description:
On the Tinsman Highway across the road, there is a solitary lost and forgotten grave. At exactly three in the morning, a pale form of a man in a old confederate uniform appears for a mere second, and is gone. Also, if you sit on, touch, or disturb the grave in any way, a false sense of security falls over you. Things like car keys, hairbrushes and small objects are often misplaced.
