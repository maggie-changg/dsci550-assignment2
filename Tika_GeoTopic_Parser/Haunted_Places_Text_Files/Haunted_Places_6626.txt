Location: Officer's Row

Description:
Nelson Residence - Reported in the local paper - There is a house two spaces left of The Grant House on Officer's Row and the house is home to Admiral Paul Nelson a great grandson of the former president William Howard Taft. when you enter the house on a Saturday, Sunday, Monday or Tuesday then you will see that the grass in front of the house is dead and brown and when you go inside there is a substance that looks like blood dripping from the walls...in the paper it said that Admiral Nelson's wife has spent hours among hours scrubbing the walls and the blood keeps appearing, no one knows for sure why blood drips from the walls or why the grass keeps dying and coming back to normal. - WARNING if you don't look up Admiral Nelson's phone number and ask him if you may come check the house out then he will consider you trespassing and you will be arrested and if he does let you in he frisks you for cameras and audio recording....no joke so be careful.
