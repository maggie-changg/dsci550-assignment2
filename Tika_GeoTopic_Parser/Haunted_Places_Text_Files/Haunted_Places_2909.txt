Location: Maricopa Point

Description:
A man in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), fell over the edge of the canyon while putting railings up in the 30's. At sundown, you can usually see a black misty figure near the railings. A fairly loud scraping sound is heard as the figure seems as though itâ€™s shoveling something.
