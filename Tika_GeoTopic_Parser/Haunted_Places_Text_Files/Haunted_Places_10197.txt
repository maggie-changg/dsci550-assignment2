Location: Burnt Bridge

Description:
The legend has it that on the old bridge there would be a young girl in a prom dress ride across the bridge on the hood of your car around midnight. Seems she and her boyfriend were killed on prom night on that bridge. There is a new bridge now and the girl no longer rides.
