Location: Pine Ridge High School/Old Auditorium

Description:
An old woman was seen by Security Guards in one of the classrooms. When they went to check in the room, nobody was there. In the old Auditorium, a boy had an heart attack in the 1950's. He was alone when it happened so, he wasn't found until later. He now haunts the place.
