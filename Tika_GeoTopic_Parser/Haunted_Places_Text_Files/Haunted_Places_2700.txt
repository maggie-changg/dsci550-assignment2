Description:
Lon Chaney Sr.'s ghost is often seen running in the catwalks above the stage, he is often wearing a phantom-like cape. He usually lets his presence be known by opening and closing doors, flickering lights off and on. One strange event that happens is the tinkling of a chandelier that was removed from the set years ago, one of the original props from the movie.
