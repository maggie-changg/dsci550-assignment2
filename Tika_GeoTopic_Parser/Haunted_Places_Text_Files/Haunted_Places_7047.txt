Location: Mount Hope Cemetery

Description:
As you enter this cemetery which has been there since the early 1800s you an hear the sounds of horses even though there arenâ€™t any horse farms around for miles and if you whistle someone will whistle with you it is pretty freaky and there are mausoleums that you can walk in to and many weirdly inscribed tombs like "knock three times and they shall come"
