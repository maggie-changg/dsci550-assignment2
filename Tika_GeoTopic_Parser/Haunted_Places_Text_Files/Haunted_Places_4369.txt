Location: Union Cemetery

Description:
Young girl walks the roadway heading towards up-town, in front of the cemetery. She is dressed in white. When you offer her a ride she will not speak but get in and disappear by the time you get to the main part of town. No one knows who she is or where she is trying to go.
