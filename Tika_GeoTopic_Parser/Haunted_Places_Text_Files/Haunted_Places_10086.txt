Description:
Womens' Correctional Institute - 2 little children ride their bikes at night up and down the halls. You can hear a little girl crying through the vents in the shower room, especially when there are no more than 1 or 2 persons present. She states her name is Jamie, she is 7-years-old, and she is looking for her mother. You can hear a man fussing and a woman screaming for help. After all, the prison is built on top of the old "POTTERS FIELD".
