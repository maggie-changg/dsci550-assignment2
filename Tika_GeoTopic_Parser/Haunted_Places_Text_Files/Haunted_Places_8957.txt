Location: Concordia Cemetery

Description:
Traffic noise is a factor but how do you explain sounds of children playing and laughing at two in the morning. There is a section of the cemetery were score of children were buried after they died during a small pox epidemic. You can hear the hoof beats of Calvary soldiers, and just general conversation, but never really understanding the words just recognizing the human voices.
