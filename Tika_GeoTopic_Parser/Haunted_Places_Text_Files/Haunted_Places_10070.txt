Location: Pachette Playhouse

Description:
Last used as a playhouse and dancehall back in the summer of '99. Here figures in paintings and photographs on the walls animate, mirrors bleed, people are pushed down the front steps by an invisible force and many more things too numerous to mention here. From the outside you may see faces in the second story windows or a strange purple light moving about the rooms.
