Location: Delta King River Boat

Description:
Theater - An old paddle wheel boat docked at Old Sacramento, now used as a theater and restaurant. The theater is haunted by the ghost of the original captain. Employees have seen him sitting in the balcony during productions; footsteps are heard above deck, a glass of water spilled by unseen force onto the soundboard in the sound booth.
