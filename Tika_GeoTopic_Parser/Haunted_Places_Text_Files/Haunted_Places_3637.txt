Location: Old Courthouse on Main Street

Description:
Reporters have investigated and it’s said to be haunted by a ghost that occupies the top floor. It was an old courthouse, but now it’s just a museum to artifacts of a variety of old things. The blinds open and shut by themselves, and knocking can be heard in the upstairs kitchen and bathroom. A door was sealed off in the bathroom and the knocking usually comes from outside the door, only outside the door is nothing but the world. A wall was built behind the door and the knocking, noises and movement have yet to be explained.
