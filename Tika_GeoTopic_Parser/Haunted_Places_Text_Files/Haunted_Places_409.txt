Location: Pegasus Sports

Description:
In downtown Rockford, there is an old building that used to be a bridal store. Before that, it was a restaurant. When it was completed, a young girl was murdered in the attic. Now, the attic is host to cold spots, screaming, orbs, and apparitions. - October 2007 Update/Correction: the owner of Pegasus Sports said that the noises and such in the attic were true, but that was in the old Pegasus building a few blocks away. The old building was demolished. He says that their new location is ghost free.
