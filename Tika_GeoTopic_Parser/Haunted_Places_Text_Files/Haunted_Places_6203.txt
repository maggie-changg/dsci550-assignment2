Location: North Court Cemetery

Description:
When you walk through it at night you'll see on some tomb stones dark figures sitting on them. And you will see some dark figures run behind trees but if u go check it out there is nothing there. and sometimes if you walk on the grass n look down u might see a white cat run in circles around your feet and disappear. you might hear whispering in your ears as well and footsteps in the grass.
