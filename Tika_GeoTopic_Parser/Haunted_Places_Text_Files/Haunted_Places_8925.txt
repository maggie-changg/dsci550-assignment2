Location: LBJ House

Description:
Supposedly there is supposed to be blood on the walls and some areas of the house where the wife and children were sacrificed and there is a really cold feeling if you stand in a certain place, but I've never talked to anyone who has seen that personally. Also the property has been abandoned for several decades and no one will buy the lot.
