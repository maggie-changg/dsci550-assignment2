Location: White Rock Lake

Description:
The Lady of the Lake - or White Lady has been seen here and on the road by the lake - dressed in a 1920's evening gown and soaking wet - she asks drivers for a ride to a house on Gaston Ave where she disappears leaving nothing but a wet stain on the seat. The story is that she was the daughter of a wealthy family in the 1920's. She was on her way home from a ball when her car wrecked in the lake - she drowned, but the others lived.
