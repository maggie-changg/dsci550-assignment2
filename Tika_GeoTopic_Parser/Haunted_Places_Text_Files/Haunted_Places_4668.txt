Description:
The Five Bridges Ghosts - In the early 1900's a man and his wife were driving on 5 Bridges Road in the suburb of Chapanoke and they got a flat tire. He got out to change it, and when he got back in the car, she was gone. He looked around for her, and saw her hanging in a tree. Someone had hung her and he was never found. If you go out there at night, turn off the lights on your truck/car, you'll hear someone knock for a ride home. Also, it's been reported that you can see her dangling from a tree, and something will sound like footsteps walking across the top of your car.
