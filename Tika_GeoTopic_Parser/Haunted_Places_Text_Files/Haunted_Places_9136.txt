Location: Sabine River

Description:
In the 1800's and old lady named Annie lived deep in the woods off the river bank. She was accused of being a witch. A group of men went to her small shack one night to kill her. They drug her outside, chained her to a tree and beat her to death. If you can find the remains of the old shack, you can hear chains dragging across the floor, screaming, and the sounds of whips.
