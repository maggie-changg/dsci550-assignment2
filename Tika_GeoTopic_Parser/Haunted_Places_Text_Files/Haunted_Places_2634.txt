Location: Midnight Adult Books

Description:
Supposedly a man was stabbed during a bad drug deal back when the property belonged to a nightclub. Three Adult bookstores all owned by one company sit next to each other where that club used to be. Employees have reported sightings of a man in a cowboy hat who has a tendency of entering occupied video booths and not being there when the clerks react, since no more than one person is allowed in a booth at a time. Also the stores experience odd noises at night and have the odd object fall off of shelves as well as shadowy shapes moving about every now and again.
