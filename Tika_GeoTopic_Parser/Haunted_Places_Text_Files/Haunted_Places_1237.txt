In side the in many of worker have seen strange things such as hearing soft music and a woman’s voice late at night, after cleaning the dining room then coming back in to fid dishes, chairs and tables moved around, doors opening and closing by themselves, and objects like plates and glasses being moved around.In the late 1800's the Colye family lived in the house where the Accomac is now. It is along the Susquhanna River. Johnny Colye, lived there with his Father (a Farmer, and a talented ferry navigator on the river) and his mother.  His father hired a young women to assist his mother with various jobs. Johnny became quite smitten with her, and had asked her to be with him. She did not, however feel the same way about Johnny as he did for her. Enraged Johnny Killed her in the Barn, about 50 yards from the house. He was arrested and hung for his crime. His gravesite is about 100 yards from the house, tombstone still marks it, and it is readable. His epitaph reads "Weap not mother, for I am not dead, but merely sleeping." In an odd twist, in the barn caught fire in the 1950's and was burnt to the ground. It was never rebuild. exactly one year later, the original house burnt to the ground, it was re-built, exactly like the original. There is now a parking lot where the barn was, but if you walk about a 100 yards to the left of the inn, you will find the tombstone and the grave of Johnny Coyle.
