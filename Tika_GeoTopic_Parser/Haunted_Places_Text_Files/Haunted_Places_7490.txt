Description:
Battlefield Park - In the front, battles are still going on. You can usually see or hear them around 1am every night. Also, a path runs thru the park for visitors and if you're lucky you can photo a ghost. Many of these pictures have been published in the Richmond Times Dispatch and Mechanicsville Local.
