Ada,United States,"Ada witch - Sometimes you can see a misty blue figure floating within a 3-mile radius of the Ada Cemetery on 2 Mile between Egypt Valley and Honey Creek. The story of her origin is as follows: A man suspected his wife of having an affair, so he followed her late one night when she thought he was asleep. Sure enough, she went to a field near their property where she met her lover. The husband was enraged and killed his wife, which resulted in a struggle with the other man. Both men died from their injuries. It is said that late at night (especially during the night of and the nights preceding a full moon) people driving by the field can see her ghost, searching for her lover. Some people have reported stopping to try to communicate with her, but she always disappears or runs into the woods where she cannot be followed (due to the thick brambles that inhabit the area). She is said to dress in a long white gown which authorities say dates her to the turn of the 20th century. Usually she is seen alone, but sometimes witnesses report seeing a ghostly death scene re-enacted... Others report seeing nothing at all but hearing the killer's shouts of rage followed by the victims' screams of agony... Although it is said she haunts the field on Honeycreek Road where she died, other witnesses have reported her in nearby Seidman Park, and in nearby Findlay Cemetery, where she is supposedly buried. This story was actually featured in the book ""Ghosts of Grand Rapids.""",Ada Cemetery,Michigan,MI,-85.50489309999999,42.9621061,-85.4954803,42.960727,True,True,2025/03/03,8,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"4,548",25.5,5.75,19.8%,5.6,7.9,1.8,4.3,40.2%,67.9%,59.6%,40.4%,84.4%,2.57%,115890.0,8.162,11.018,2.84,50251.92857142857,632.2142857142857,289907.0714285714,123.0,121.0,Above Average,734.0,324.0,165.0,80.0,56.0,31.0,78.0

Adrian,United States,"If you take Gorman Rd. west towards Sand Creek, you will come to a gravel road leading north. A mile or so up this road you will come to narrow one lane trestle bridge. The road goes under this. Legend has it that at one time there was a farm house built near the tracks. Late one night a fire broke out in the barn. While the father ran to the barn to try to get the horses out, his wife and young son went to the tracks to wave down one of the many trains that would use that right of way. They were too close to the tracks however and both were struck by the train as it went past. The father was killed in the barn. Now if you go out there late at night, you can sometimes communicate with the Father. He will not allow you to talk to his wife or son; as if he was protecting them . There are other people living in the area now, and a large streetlight has been placed there by the people who own the neighboring land. If you stay there to long, they will call the police. However if you make your visit short enough they will usually leave you to it. This place has also been described as a good place to go to contact other spirits.

Adrian,United States,"In the 1970's, one room, room 211, in the old section of the dorms exhibited several phenomena. Don't know if this still continues today. The door into the room from the hallway, as well as the door into the bathroom, would open and shut on their own, the main door even if it had been locked. After closing, it would be locked again. There was also a spot on one wall (a wall that the room shared with a boarded up, no longer used laundry shaft) where two points of light would appear, shaped similar to eyes. Attempts were made to explain their appearance (they were visible any time it was dark in the room). They were screened off from the windows to see if they might be reflections, they weren't. When objects were placed between them and the windows they actually became brighter. We tried painting the walls, putting several coats of paint over them (thinking they may have been a joke of a previous resident, made with glow in the dark paint) - also having used sandpaper on the wall in that spot first before painting. They still appeared bright as ever after the painting. We tried covering them over by hanging a picture over them, but the picture kept falling down or moving. Last attempt to hang picture (it was a drawing on a piece of paper and simply taped to the wall) resulted in us waking up the next morning to find it taped to the ceiling over my bed. We finally moved a tall dresser in front of it and that seemed to take care of it. Reports from later residents told us that they had placed a mirror over it, and they had a rocker in the room. One night during a party, with several witnesses, the rocker began rocking on its own, then flew back and smashed the mirror.

A man and woman dressed in late '20s - early '30s garb have been seen many times over the years, not only by owners' families, but also by employees and customers alike. The descriptions are uncannily similar. A customer recently reported the man and woman ghosts dancing together in the bar area with a little girl ghost looking on. These ghosts also window peep (on the second floor). They certainly appear to be fun loving. Another story tells of the daughter of a former hotel manager, who was preparing to elope with her fiancée, and tripped on her gown while descending the ladder. She fell to her death and returns to walk the hallway upstairs in her wedding gown. And, it is a fact that Mrs. Gill who, with her husband, were the first managers of the hotel, returned and lived out her remaining years at the hotel. She died in the early '50s in one of the upstairs bedrooms. Many people have reported seeing her stand in the upstairs window looking onto the village.

Harrison,United States,"There are many stories about this house. One is the mother (Mrs. Reinke) was standing in her kitchen putting away groceries, and looked up and saw twin daughters (around 6 years old) holding hands and walking toward her. They walked right past her and out the door down towards Budd Lake. Another story is the large man story. Mr. Reinke was tying up his boat when he looked up into his bedroom window and saw a large figure of a man in the window. He rushed up to make sure everything was ok and when he got there, nothing was in the room. Soon after, another sighting of this large man happened. The daughter was sleeping when she noticed that a light was coming from her closet. The way the light comes through the window it would be impossible to be shining into the closet. She looked away, and when she looked back, saw a large man in her closet, the same man her dad had seen earlier. She described the man looking just the way her dad had seen, and he hadn't told anyone about the man yet (he didn't want to look stupid). The next day, the whole family was out of the house, and no one had been there all day. When the daughter came home, she found her room in total shambles, everything in the closet had been thrown around, and figurines and other possessions where seen lying on the ground. Another story has to do with the son. One night he could hear a bouncing ball in the attic above his room. He hears it about once every month or so, and if he gets annoyed with it, he tells the ghost or whatever is bouncing the ball to quit, and it usually does. He is very used to it, and it doesn't scare him anymore to hear it.

One also has to wonder how such a horrific tragedy as the game show story never even made it to the local news. - Off Monroe Road in Lambertville, Michigan, there is a subdivision called Lambert Estates. Lambert Estates is mostly made up of a road called Verna Drive. The subdivision was formed in 1957. In the early summer of 1978, Steven Madison, a 33-year-old worker for a glass plant in Toledo, Ohio, walked into a home on Verna Drive and killed an elderly couple with a hammer found in the garage. He then moved into several other houses that night, and killed 7 others. 3 male adults, 1 female adult, 2 male children, and 2 female children. He used a block of firewood to kill a family of 3, a wood saw to kill a young college graduate, and smothered or strangled the other 3. He then went into the woods next to the neighborhood and hung himself from a maple tree. Reports of screams often come from two houses in the neighborhood. In the early July's, residents report a figure of a man walking down the street carrying a piece of firewood wearing a green shirt and jeans that appear to be blood stained. A neighbor once approached the man after seeing him 3 consecutive nights. When the man was asked who he was, he turned and faced the resident with a frightening wide grin and wide eyes. He walked off after not responding and disappeared in the front yard of an residents house. He was also reported seen in the woods, hanging from a tree, when the owner of the woods walked in one evening while walking his dog. He noticed nothing out of the ordinary at first, until when standing under a tree; drops of water fell on him. He looked up and saw him hanging by his neck as if he just died. The water was apparently tears that the man shed. An investigation was conducted to investigate the level of paranormal activity. The investigation was part of a game show where a group of people spent a week in the now abandoned neighborhood, to determine whether it was haunted. By the end of the week, a member of the investigating team disappeared and had not been found until two months later. He was found nearly dead in the glass plant in Toledo wear Steven Madison was employed. To this day the neighborhood remains empty, yet still stands. - June 2008 Update - The first posting for Lambert estates indicates it is abandoned. The update then states that the neighborhood never existed. Actually, not only has it existed, it remains very much occupied to this day. Every house is very well maintained. However, it is not in Temperance, it is in Lambertville, the next town over.",formerly listed in Temperance,Michigan,MI,-83.62601099999999,41.75810800000001,-83.624201,41.75290880000001,True,True,1957/03/13,2,Evening,Ghost (Male),Murder,"4,548",25.5,5.75,19.8%,5.6,7.9,1.8,4.3,40.2%,67.9%,59.6%,40.4%,84.4%,2.57%,115890.0,8.162,11.018,2.84,50251.92857142857,632.2142857142857,289907.0714285714,123.0,121.0,Above Average,734.0,324.0,165.0,80.0,56.0,31.0,78.0

The Indians snuck up behind them and with a few swift chops of their hatchets the soldiers were decapitated. The Indians brought their heads back to the fort and collected their bounty.

Marine City,United States,"Once in a great while employees of the kitchen claim that machines will turn on when no one is around, such as mixers, dishwasher, etc. The very rare occasions have pretty much stopped but just recently in the summer of 2003 a radio/C.D. player boombox was said to ""have a mind of it's own"". It started with the volume increasing by it's self over the corse of 5-10 minutes to the point where it was full blast and had to be turned down. But a little while later it would turn it's self up again, blaring loud and causing frusteration among employees. One Sunday morning during a busy breakfast rush, a frusterated employee turned the power button off since it wouldn't stay at a reasonable volume level. Minutes later the radio suddenly turned on loud as can be. The red-faced employee turned it off again, and five minutes later the words ""sugar, sugar, oh honey, honey!"" came blaring out of the speakers (the radio station was placed at 104.3, oldies station). The employee grabbed the radio, unplugged it and sat it underneath a table. This ended the incents for that day and the night crew workers claimed they had no problems with the radio at all after they plugged it in that same night. All week the radio was fine until Sunday morning came. The breakfast buffet near the dining room was getting busy and kitchen workers became busy as well. The radio started turning it's self up again. The same employee from last Sunday battled it for 2 hours having to turn the volume down every 10-15 minutes. Everyone thought it was broken or something. He eventually turned it off and became very frusterated. And about 20 minutes later, the song ""Edge Of Seventeen"" by Stevie Nicks suddenly blared from the radio. The employee stared at the radio shaking his head as workers yelled for him to turn it down. He gritted his teeth, unplugged it, and wrapped the cord around it. It remained silent and still for an hour until it suddenly ""hurled it's self towards him"" but missed him by a few inches and hit the floor. The radio was permanently shot and would not work after this incident. Other strange incidents involved objects disappearing (knives, utinsils, etc.) while employees were just using them seconds earlier. After searching the kitchen for them they would be neatly placed where the cooks had originally placed them. Also, the same employee that dealed with the radio incident claimed that vegetables such as squash, potatoes, etc. would be neatly placed on a cutting board but nobody needed them and would have to be put back. This also occured with other items. One time a 5-gallon jug of milk was found sitting on a table in the kitchen. After checking the milk machine it was full with milk. He asked around if anyone got the milk out. Puzzled, the waitresses said no. He placed the milk jug back in the walk in refrigerator. He began chopping up some vegetables when all of the sudden an entire shelf of pizza pans (about 15 inches wide and 30 inches high) fell spreading loud bobbling pizza pans all over the floor. Seconds later 3 metal hotel pans fell off a shelf causing a he racket. The frusterated employee walked out, but returned the next day for work. This was like the grand finale for the poltergeist, if it even was a poltergeist, because nothing has happened since for several months. These events started out of the blue and only lasted two weeks and then abruptly stopped.

Trenton,United States,"A family called the Church family built the old hospital in the 1800s. It was their house until they died and their other family members didn't want anything to do with the house, so Henry Ford bought the old house and turned it into a hospital in 1944. The kids included in the family were two boys and a 9-year-old girl. The 9-year old girl loved horses so they had five horses. So, in that case, there are horse stables in the back. The little girl loved her horse and rode it everyday. Until one day, the little girl fell off the horse and broke her arm. The dad got mad and thought it was the horse's fault that his little girl broke her arm. So while she was at school one day, her dad killed the horse for hurting his little girl. The dad and his friend buried the horse on the side of their house. If you go to the side of the house where the dad and his friend buried the horse, there will be a little hill where the horse is. When the little girl came home and found out what her dad did, everyday from then on, she would come home from school, lock hers in her room, put her rocking chair in front of her window and she would sing to herself. Well, when the family died and Henry Ford bought the house, that was then the hospital, there was an old man that was in the hospital and his hospital room was what used to be the little girl's bedroom. While he was lying there in his bed, he heard singing, then he heard footsteps. When he got out of the hospital, he had someone set up thermal cameras in the room he was in and sure enough, they saw a figure in front of the window. After Henry Ford bought the hospital, six doctors wanted to build a bigger one and that's how the newer Riverside Hospital came about. They ended up closing down the old hospital 5 years ago because they found black mold growing in the building, which can kill you. They closed down the newer hospital one year ago because it was too much to keep up. Also, the Henry Ford company wanted to move everything to Wyandotte so Riverside lost business. There is a stack by the hospital. In a little tunnel thing outside of the new hospital, there is a furnace type thing. That's where they burned the amputated body parts of people. Also in that little tunnel, is the old morgue. THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL SEEN IN THE WINDOW THAT WAS MENTIONED ABOVE. SHE WAS WEARING A WHITE DRESS WITH BROWN CURLY HAIR AND BOWS IN HER HAIR.

Not moving farther away, just around, sometimes back to where you were just standing. Just walking by the field would make your hair stand on end. The land was developed within the past couple of years. A subdivision now stands on this land. But, the field was on the south side of Thirteen Mile Rd., between Meadowbrook Rd., and Decker.

Altoona,United States,"Beulah Road -  This legend is a cross between the spectral hitchhiker stories you have heard before and the sort of ""Resurrection Mary"" type tales familiar to the Chicago area. the ghost of the white lady still walks at night. For historical background there used to be a hotel at the top of the Wopsononock Mountain that was a fairly common getaway for people in Altoona. The Wopsononock hotel and famous lookout burned in the early part of the 20th century and was never rebuilt. In fact, at one time it was serviced by a narrow gauge railroad know as the ""Alley Popper"" although that has nothing to do with this tale. The road heading up to the Wopsy Lookout (as it is known hereabouts) is now Juniata Gap road in Altoona. This road is a treacherous one bearing a curve known as the ""Devil's Elbow"" which has been the scene of many accidents. Apparently in the early part of the century a couple was married and was heading to the hotel at the lookout for their honeymoon. I know nothing of the father chasing them which is related to the Ebensburg tale you have given. The legend goes that they were both from Altoona and were heading up the road leading to the hotel when the carriage went over the edge rounding the Devil's Elbow. Both were apparently killed but the body of the husband was never recovered. Since then travelers on this road have encountered the specter of a woman in white, sometimes seen to be carrying a candle, who apparently is looking for something. Variations on the tale have her waylaying young men and looking them over to see if they are her husband, or hitching rides with young men headed for the top of the mountain and then disappearing near the Devil's Elbow. Apparently this spirit has also been seen on the road leading up the mountain where the lookout can be accessed from the other direction, Buckhorn Mountain, and she is also known as the ""White Lady of the Buckhorn"" as well as the ""White Lady of Wopsononock"". The site of the old hotel now is littered with television and radio towers and is still a sort of ""lover's lane"" spot for a lot of folks. Apparently some of the technicians at the towers have reported seeing her, but the most recent account (late 1990's) involved a man who offered her a ride. She apparently got into the car and he could not see her in the rear view mirror but could see her when he turned around. She said nothing to him and disappeared at the Devil's Elbow. Much like Resurrection Mary, it is a difficult tale to dispute since it has occurred so often to so many people over such a long stretch of time. Although the historical details are sketchy! No one knows who she was or when the accident actually took place. If you ever get a chance to get to this area take a trip on either road and you may get a chance to run into her.",Wapsononock Mountain,Pennsylvania,PA,,,-78.3947359,40.5186809,True,True,2025/03/13,4,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"5,703",26.2,5.52,18.5%,5.5,7.9,1.8,3.9,45.4%,69.0%,52.4%,47.6%,81.7%,2.67%,149637.0,9.544,12.885,2.59,48587.07142857143,670.5,288389.0714285714,128.0,121.0,Above Average,144.0,53.0,33.0,19.0,11.0,16.0,10.0

Carbon County,United States,"Jim Thorpe - The old Carbon County Prison was last used in 1995. There have been numerous reports of unexplained phenomena at the prison in recent years. The most famous ghost story associated with the prison is the hand print left in a cell by a man wrongfully accused of being a member of the Molly Maguires. The Molly Maguires were a group of disgruntled miners in the 1870's who used violence as a means to bring about change in the corrupt mining industry. Several men were accused, arrested, and eventually hanged at the prison for being Molly Maguires. On the eve of his execution, a man who proclaimed his innocence ran his hand along the dirty floor of his cell and made an impression of his hand on the wall, claiming the impression would always remain as proof of his innocence. The next day, he was hung and the hand print was washed away. Three days later, the print reappeared. As legend has it, the wall has been repeatedly washed and painted, but the hand print always returns. The wall was supposedly even ripped down and re-plastered, but the hand print returned yet again. The prison is now opened to tourist, but the cell with the hand print is off limits. Visitors can still view the print through the cell door, though.",old Carbon County Prison,Pennsylvania,PA,-75.78172529999999,40.8775327,-75.667356,40.901975,False,True,1995/03/13,0,Unknown,Ghost (Male),Murder,"5,703",26.2,5.52,18.5%,5.5,7.9,1.8,3.9,45.4%,69.0%,52.4%,47.6%,81.7%,2.67%,149637.0,9.544,12.885,2.59,48587.07142857143,670.5,288389.0714285714,128.0,121.0,Above Average,144.0,53.0,33.0,19.0,11.0,16.0,10.0

Drexel Hill,United States,"Originally the old Drexel Estate and then later before the school an orphanage- there are 2 tales here. The 1st is the story of an orphan that was murdered by another. On the second floor of the school there are still 2 halls left with the original bedrooms- still not converted to classrooms. The halls are on the same floor as the chapel. Students have claimed to see furniture move in those rooms. There is 1 old rocking horse in particular that will ALWAYS MOVE ON ITS OWN when the room is occupied for too long. Because of the hostile vibe felt in that room, people believe that is the spirit of the murdering orphan, who also died there due to a ""freak"" accident. There are also reports of students seeing two children late at night, running, fighting, and screaming through those halls. The 2nd story is the tale of a nun who taught at the orphanage. She hung herself in the bell tower and haunts it to this day. Many times the bell will ring unexpectedly and late at night a light will go on and off. Unlike the modern light that is suppose to be up there (which seems to always mysteriously short out), it looks like a candle. Students who have tried to get up there have been spooked severely.

There is an entrance on Cameron St. across from the Farm Show complex and another one off of Elmerton Ave. A hiking and biking trail called the Capital Area Green Belt leads into another entrance in the Edgemont area of the city. It closed its doors as an asylum in 2006, but the grounds and buildings are still in use today as offices for several state agencies such as the PA Office of Mental Health. There are now over 50 buildings on the grounds, although a large portion of the land is still Woodland. Many different noises from screams to footsteps are heard and many different visuals ranging from shadows to full-bodied apparitions are witnessed. The morgue, although very tiny, is 2 stories tall and the basement leads into the tunnels. There are large blood-like stains on the floor and all the exam tables are still there. There is also poltergeist activity reported in the various buildings. Be warned, it may be illegal to be on the property at night and there are some security guards. The morgue, stables, and some of the tunnel entrances are secluded enough to probably not be noticed if entered at night, and since that area is right by the Green Belt, one could enter the property from that entrance and have the car readily available, but it is probably best to try and get permission.

Manor,United States,"The Norwin Elks used to be the old Fletcher's place. He made jellies and such assortments as that. When it closed down is when all the hauntings were noticed. . . There are 3 distinct hauntings. The first haunting is in the Old Fletcher Barn (Which became the Terror Barn). One of the groundskeepers apparently had nowhere to go when Fletcher's was shutdown, so he thought he'd make a statement to the world by hanging himself in the barn facing the window on the second floor. Working there I noticed the scariest things imaginable would happen. For one thing (and they had this on tape one night while we were making a commercial for the terror barn) the radio (which was located at the other side of the barn in the ""Michael Meyer's Room"") was changing stations rapid ply and shutting off and turning on while we are all meeting in the wizard room (on the other side of the barn, nowhere near Michael Meyers).The second thing, if you lay on the torture rack and look up you can see a man who walks the rafters above. The other thing has to do withhe sound of cowboy boots following you as you walk around. The last thing is above all the scariest, a piercing scream while we were closing one night. The second haunting of the Norwin Elks is located in the bar/dining area. Apparently in the attic there is a specter who you cannot make out, but she/he is there and watches you. Some say that it is a little girl and others say it's a little boy. The third haunting is in the basement of the Norwin Elks. If you walk down there you can hear a dog barking for hours on end, but the Norwin Elks don't have any dogs. And sometimes you see a maintenance man down there who tells you that the pipes of the furnace need a cleaning, and when you ask them what's wrong he vanishes. There are other reports of a man in the bar who never leaves and when you finally force him outside he vanishes after he leaves the door. But no one can say for certain what happened to any of these ghosts. The only ghost that we know for sure is the Fletcher's Groundskeeper in the terror barn who hung himself.",Norwin Elks,Pennsylvania,PA,-79.67394070000002,40.3551341,-79.6700433,40.333958,True,True,2025/03/03,0,Night,Ghost (Male),Supernatural,"5,703",26.2,5.52,18.5%,5.5,7.9,1.8,3.9,45.4%,69.0%,52.4%,47.6%,81.7%,2.67%,149637.0,9.544,12.885,2.59,48587.07142857143,670.5,288389.0714285714,128.0,121.0,Above Average,144.0,53.0,33.0,19.0,11.0,16.0,10.0

When the station was moved in August of 2000, workers found a preserved body of a dead cat in the foundation. After the station was moved, members of the Mars Historical Society began experiencing strange happenings in the old structure. Cat sounds can be heard. What is even more disturbing is that during the restoration work, members discovered paw prints of a cat in the sawdust of a newly cut board. Some members have even reported seeing a small cat wondering around in the rooms. The members have nicknamed the ghost cat, ""Chessie"". It was named after the now retired Chessie System.

Middletown / Lima,United States,"This county home was established in Media, Pennsylvania in 1807, where it remained until 1857. It then moved to its present location in Lima on the 210-acre Abraham Pennell Farm on Middletown Road. The farm was called ""Fair Acres"", and as a county facility it retained this name. During the early years in Lima, the County facility often cared for entire families as well as individuals in a self-contained environment. A part of this facility was the operation of a farm used for the production of food items for people within the facility. The farming operation was discontinued in 1967 when the facility underwent a transition from a partially residential community to a health care facility and directed its emphasis to elderly residents of Delaware County who required medical and nursing care. With this change, ""farm"" was dropped from the name, and in 1978 the institution became the Fair Acres Geriatric Center. The Center now consists of eighteen buildings located on a 210-acre tract in Lima, Pennsylvania. Five of these are resident buildings, containing both skilled and intermediate care nursing units with total accommodations for over 900 residents.  One building in particular, Building 4, now has many separate offices and a main hallway shared by each office.  This building was originally a big, single room that held hundreds of hospital beds in rows in the late 1800's. An elderly woman with long gray, straight hair and wearing a hospital gown has been seen walking in the hallways.  She has been seen by about 5 different people in different years.

Montrose,United States,"The site of the Inn has a long history. The original Inn was used as the first jail, as a funeral home before there was a funeral home in town and as a school room. The original building burned to the ground in the mid 1920's. When the new building was about 90 percent completed it burned to the ground again. The building that stands on the site now, was completed around 1926. Upstairs in the Inn there is a little boy that roams the hall and plays trick at all times of the day and night. He seems to like room #5 the most. More than one guest reported someone knocking on the door and no one being there when the door was opened. One guest in particular complained in the morning about the child that was staying in the Inn. He had upset here during the night with knocking on the door several times during the evening and giggling. There were no other guest in the Inn that night. The shade would be taken off the window and placed neatly on the pillow. The window was about 7 feet away from the bed. The time on the clock would be changed. The arm that was set the night before would not go off ( the alarm clock was changed in that room more than once due to the complaints concerning the alarm not going off). Room doors would open then slowly close. The child was reported as seen only once. He was crouched down with his face toward the corner with his hands over his eyes and he was giggling as though he was playing hide and seek. Downstairs in the Inn is a man that has been seen on many occasions and felt many more. This man was seen walking past the front office into the coat closet on one occasion. He seemed so real that the customer in the dinning room thought that he was about to steal a coat. The customer kept his eye on the closet until he realized that no one was coming back out so he leaned back in his chair where he could see into the closet and realized that no one was there. Employees reported him walking out toward the tavern area when the dinning and tavern area were closed and all the doors were locked.

South Los Angeles,United States,"There are reports of ghostly happenings in the stock rooms of this former Zody's. It is believed that a double murder/suicide took place somewhere in the upstairs stockroom. Apparently, a couple worked together for Zody's and the boyfriend caught his girlfriend in a compromising situation with another male employee. The enraged boyfriend located a box cutter and slashed the two to death. He then slashed his own wrists and carotid artery. After several reports from employees of unusual activity, Kmart headquarters in Michigan has admitted to hiring paranormal/paraphysical investigators to conduct investigations into the incident. The conclusion was that indeed the building was occupied by several spirits. The investigators concluded that four different spirits dwell throughout the building. The fourth has not been linked to any known incident that may have occurred and thus is unknown for its presence. Kmart has remained quiet on the findings of this investigation and resources revealed that employees of this store are not advised of this activity. Prior to changing over to Kmart, Zody's employees reported seeing a man walking about in the stockroom. A woman is also seen running and sometimes screams are heard. In one case, an overnight employee sustained a 7 inch laceration while working in the stockroom. Zody's management insisted that the incident was just an accident caused by falling boxes that were stacked too high, but resources close to the victim tell another tale. A paring knife mysteriously came across the room and cut the employee across the chest. No one was seen in the area. The victim survived his wounds, but obviously resigned from the company.

One story is that a worker had locked himself accidentally in the old freezer room in the basement and passed away. Another is unknown how but a worker died from machinery falling onto him in the back of the bottom floor. Dark shadowy figures have been seen in closing time. The cleaning crew has quit after hours when a woman cleaner screamed from the bottom floor claiming she saw a black figure watching her. Electrical appliances have sounded off with no batteries inside. Pictures have fallen feet away from where they were hung. Saucers and objects for sell have rolled or flung off onto the floors. A empty space has got the most attention where stairs use to be, cold spots and sensitive customers have felt a presence there. Curiously young children who know nothing of the mall refuse sometimes to enter the basement where the freezer accident occurred. King Richards is history all around and the staff claims that they feel no threat from the strange occurrences. Sometimes you just feel like they want to be noticed or known. Oddly enough the happenings really become more active around October through the holiday season. Its hard to separate the occurrences said one worker. the Antique items that are brought in by dealers some time hold a past with them as well. But for the feeling of King Richards you see, to know the difference. No harm from these ghost's just a remembrance of Whittiers History.",King Richards Antique Center.

Hyde Park,United States,"Rumors talk of a spooky spirit within the walls of the old French opera house. The building once burned down but they rebuilt it. Talk of a woman named Esmeralda, who died in a chair in the house during the fire, comes back to haunt the children who participate in the theatrical productions. Her apparition is seen during every production by 1 or more participants in the plays, floating above the lighting on the stage with a red eye. She also has appeared to few students when they sit in the purple painted chair that she died in. Sometimes when one of actors/actresses sit in the chair before a performance, bad luck comes about to them during their performance. So next time you are there, watch out because she has her eye on you!!! - June 2005 Correction: The truth about Essie, as she's affectionately referred to here, is yes she did die in a fire here when the building was still known as French's Opera House. She is said to ""live"" in the fly loft, above the lighting instruments above the stage. There is a purple chair in the audience, on the right hand side near the stage.

Niles,United States,"A young woman who's last name was Lowerey was on her way to a wedding possibly her own. Riding in a horse drawn carriage near the way stop of Scott's Corners, (between Pleasanton and Sunol, CA. Area is now Highway 84/680) she was thrown from the carriage when the horses were spooked by the first of two oncoming horseless carriages (car). After she was thrown the 2nd car struck her. Miss Lowerey became the first person to ever be killed by an automobile in this area. Many have seen a woman in white by the cemetery and near by areas, accompanied with strange lights. - November update: A paranormal researcher found there's quite an extensive collection of newspaper clippings that was donated to the library by a journalist. The clippings go back to the turn of the 20th century, so they cover the period when the ""accident"" happened. According to the first journalist to report on the supposed haunting, about ten years after the date in the 1920's when the woman was popularly held to have died, there was no mention of anyone dying in an accident in the canyon, and county records of the time listed no account of the body of anyone who had supposedly died in Niles Canyon. There was, in the early 50's, a young man who dressed in a white sheet and jumped out in front of motorists near one of the bridges on Halloween. He scared someone so bad that they immediately drove to the nearest phone and called the police, who arrived in force (owing to the legend of the white witch) and drew guns on what they thought was the ghost. The young man was almost shot, though he was not arrested, but he had to be taken to a coffee shop where it took him until 2am to calm down sufficiently to go home. The supposed ""white witch of Niles"" actually follows the scenario of a common fake ghost story, that being the ""hitchhiking ghost"" story. The Niles ghost is most commonly said to hitchhike to one of the bridges in the area, where she disappears at the tollbooth. There is no cemetery that they know of in Sunol, which is at the top of Niles Canyon Rd. Similarly; there is no Morrison Canyon ghost. Morrison Canyon road is a primarily one-lane road that leads up to the 680 freeway. There's even a radar-testing facility up there somewhere, complete with life-size wire models of helicopters and planes, mostly upside down. Now, on the OTHER side of the coin, there ARE photographs of orbs in Mission San Jose's church and in the graveyard, though the investigator does not own them. The church, the cemetery and the grounds are VERY active.","Niles Canyon Road- A ""White Witch"" or ""Niles Canyon Ghost""",California,CA,-121.8889721,37.594091,-121.9871217,37.58366890000001,False,True,2025/03/02,1,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"15,443",24.4,5.04,16.6%,5.5,7.7,1.6,3.7,40.0%,69.1%,64.4%,35.6%,86.1%,2.49%,376899.0,35.011,47.264,3.29,181495.2857142857,2121.0714285714284,1091981.142857143,118.0,103.0,Above Average,338.0,87.0,51.0,105.0,57.0,30.0,9.0
