Dorothy Peryam and her first husband, Horace Quivey, her brother John and his wife, Eda, were camped in the area in 1918. The men were marking timber there for the Forestry Service. It was dusk and they had made their campfire. Dorothy and John were standing close to the road when they heard a hollow cough and looked up to see a man walking down the road toward them. He walked past them, not looking to the right or left, or at them. They could not hear his footsteps as he walked by. It was very peculiar in those days for a stranger to be alone in the mountains at dark without a horse or supplies. He would have approached the fire to talk. But this person acted as though they weren't there. Charles M. Scribner ran a stage line between Battle and Encampment.

Laramie,United States,"In the original part of the building built in the mid 1800's, ghost are known to turn on radios, scatter items about the old class rooms, cause the phones the ring, and open windows. The original building was built on a graveyard. It is said a music teacher hung himself in newer north part. - January 2007 Additional information/Correction: The building was not built on a graveyard. What happened back in the late 1800's was that there were some vigilante killings because a gang had taken over Laramie. Some of the bodies were buried in the vicinity of the Civic Center. They were buried all over the area. The townspeople made sure to rebury the bodies elsewhere before building the School, which is now the Civic Center. There is no way the bodies are still there as there is a basement that has to be at least 10 feet below the surface. There were no known suicides in the school or civic center. A woman did die of cancer in the building back in the 1970's. There was a janitor that died in the hospital of cancer and another janitor that died in his apartment of a brain injury. A witness reports seeing shadows darting around. They have had a terrible experience of an electric door slamming furiously one night around 10pm. The power to the door was turned off at the time it occurred. They walked through some rose scented perfume one time that wouldn't move or dissipate. They have heard voices when no one was there & heard footsteps and running when no one was there. It is possible That some has to be residual haunting such as hearing a basketball game going on. also heard Indian drumming at night. Also working late and was standing next to the copy machine, which was turned off. It came on suddenly. They have had the door to their office open and heard someone come in, but when they looked, the door wasn't open and no one was there.

Rawlins,United States,"A.K.A - The Old Pen - The ""Old Pen"", as it is affectionately called by citizens of Rawlins, was put out of use in the early 1980's. Now the Old Pen is a tourist attraction, a historical site, and the subject of many tales of paranormal activity. Members of tour groups often report hearing strange voices in cells, seeing people disappear around corners, and feeling hostile or tense presences. Employees have also reported apparitions and sounds. There was recently an investigation by a group of paranormal experts, but specifics were not revealed except in vague terms. There are several hotbeds of activity in the prison, including the showers, Death Row, the Gas Chamber, and the Hold (isolation area), and certain specific cells, including one filled with the artwork of an inmate. Only recently restored were the Chapel and women's facility, also suspected of paranormal activity. Public functions are now held in the prison, including bazaars and Halloween ""haunted house"" tours. During the bazaars, booths were set up on ground level, near the shower area. The shower area was always inexplicably cold, with a sense of malice. Many inmates were attacked in the shower area.

Ashland,United States,"It is said that during some early renovation work on the Paramount Theatre, a death occurred there and the man’s ghost has forever since haunted the Paramount. In the early 1940s, four construction workers from Boyd Theater Company in Cincinnati, Ohio were working on a project inside the auditorium. It is reported that all of them had gone to lunch except one man, a guy named Joe. When the other three returned, they found Joe hanging from the curtain rigging, dead. And since then, sounds have been heard, things have gone missing, cold drafts have been felt, and some folks even claim to have seen the image of a man appear on occasion. However, he is by all means a “good ghost” - one who seems to look out for the benefit of the theatre and its occupants. When Billy Ray Cyrus was here filming his video for ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" he was told about the legend of Paramount Joe. Between breaks, Billy Ray would talk to Joe, laughing and joking with him, sometimes even asking for his help. It is customary to get 8 x 10 photographs signed by each performer that appears at the Paramount and then hang the photo on the 'Wall of Fame' in the box office. Billy Ray personally autographed large color posters to each of the female employees working here at the time - and one with a personal inscription to Paramount Joe, whom he now had a fondness for. Each lady put her poster near her desk and Joe's was hung in the box office, near all the other performers. As time passed and the walls in the box office became too full of 8x10’s signed by other performers, the executive director felt that some of the pictures and posters needed to come down. Since there were so many of Billy Ray, she asked the women to remove their posters since they were all so similar. Nobody wanted to take their personally autographed picture of Billy Ray down so they took down the one he had signed to Paramount Joe. The next day, when the ladies came to work, every single 8x10 and poster that had been hanging neatly on the walls the night before were now lined strewn on the floor, many of their glass frames shattered! It was as if someone had wiped each one off the wall. To this day, Paramount Joe’s poster still hangs in the Paramount, in a very special part of The Marquee Room, which is now the site of Paramount Joe’s Rising Star Café’. There is another story about the time two new employees wanted to investigate the basement in the Paramount and some old items that had been stored there. To reach the basement, you must go through a door that is located just inside the lounge outside the ladies restroom. This brings you to the top of the stairs. At the top of those stairs is a light switch that will light the first section of the stairwell. As you progress, there is a switch that will light each area in front of you. And, there is no partner switch. In other words, you must turn the light off at the same place you turned it on. The marketing director had offered to take the two new female employees into the basement and turned on the lights at the top of the stairs. The ladies hurried down the steps. At that moment the marketing director was called to take a phone call inside the office. He told the other two employees to wait, he would be right back. In their excitement however, they did not hear him and they continued on. Recounting the story later, it was at this point they called up to him to turn on the next light for them. As it turned out, he was on the phone longer than expected and met the ladies as they were coming back up the steps. ""Thanks for turning on the light for us,"" one of them said, ""but we can't get it to turn off."" Puzzled, he explained that he had not turned on the light for them – and in fact, could not turn on the light. The expression on their faces revealed that they were not kidding with him. They lead him back into the basement, only to be met by darkness. 'Someone' had turned the light off again as well. ""Well, thanks Joe,"" called out one of the ladies, as she shivered. In 2004, marketing director Tyson Compton was giving a tour to some high school students. As he was relating the Paramount Joe story, he realized that he was always talking about Joe, and not to him. So as he spoke to the students, he stopped and called out, “Joe, are you here? Is it ok that I tell your story?” While he swears that he then heard a seat squeak, that is not the the most chilling part of this story. Compton relates how he received a call the very next day from a psychic who lived in the area. She asked him if someone in his family or a close friend had recently died because she had gotten a message from “the other side.” He said no that he could think of no one. “Well, she said, “I’m supposed to tell you that Joe said he is here.”",Paramount Art Center,Kentucky,KY,-82.6428131,38.4801198,-82.63793869999999,38.4784144,True,True,2025/03/08,2,Night,"Ghost (Male, performer)",Death,"2,206",27.0,6.31,15.8%,5.7,8.8,1.9,5.0,40.2%,70.6%,53.5%,46.5%,83.7%,2.67%,59519.0,3.195,4.313,3.19,10717.857142857143,186.78571428571428,108398.21428571428,125.0,109.0,Above Average,354.0,87.0,45.0,106.0,43.0,55.0,19.0,11.83,It_is_said_that_during_some_early_renovation_work.png

One day the robbers decided to leave and didn't want anyone to know of their surroundings; they threatened the old woman and decided to kill her.

Jamestown,United States,"AKA Lydia's Bridge - Just outside of Greensboro, there has said to have been the ghost of a beautiful young girl who has been appearing near Greensboro since 1923. She stands next to the US Highway 70 Underpass in a white evening gown and waves frantically for someone to stop and pick her up. Those hapless travelers who do are introduced to a young woman who says her name is Lydia and she always ask them to please take her to an address in High Point. She always tells them that she has spent the evening at a dance in Raleigh and is anxious to get home, having run into car trouble on the way. Just as the drivers approach the house, the girl always vanishes from their car, never opening the door and getting out.-  March 2004 additional info: There are many versions to the story but the most common one that I have heard is that Lydia was at a dance one night and was trying to get home. A car apparently hit her and now she hitches rides home from the bridge. When the person gets her to her house, she disappears. She never says anything other than her name is Lydia; she needs to get home, and her address. Another story posted on www.dawghouse.topcities.com/northcarolina.html.  Either way, she died in 1923. The road that linked High Point and Greensboro was a different road than is there now. There are train tracks that are the reason for the bridge. The bridge now is called the graffiti bridge, for obvious reasons. To the left of this bridge, about 40 ft away and hidden in massive amounts of kudzu, is where the original bridge is, and it's Lydia's bridge. There is another bridge about 2 miles away from these that is also believed to be Lydia's bridge. This one is an actual bridge that you drive over and it's over a creek. Some kids have spray painted pentagrams on it which is kind of freaky but at the same time, there is a sort of eerie presence here. One report of a group of friends in the 80’s that would venture there had two girls in this group and every time they would get close to the bridge, the girls would pass out. www.hauntednc.com says that Lydia is merely an urban legend.

Monroe,United States,"The old Blakney House is located on Franklin St. Believed to be haunted by William Blakney, a greedy miser who has hidden his fortune somewhere in the house. There is also rumored talk about a girl, perhaps related to Blakney, who watched her parents get run over from the upstairs window. The house was first renovated and remodeled about 15 years ago to house a privately owned ""Boswell's Restaurant."" Prior to the remodeling, neighborhood kids were told not to go around the house, but that might have been just adults against trespassing. Once the restaurant opened, employees began to report strange things, such as dishes (entire cabinets full) relocated, tables being moved, and other odd anomalies. One account, involved a luncheon on the 2nd floor in one of the reserve rooms. Only two people were at the restaurant (it didn't open until lunch) and they set up elaborate place settings for the luncheon. As they went downstairs to start preparing further, loud crashes and bangs were heard from the upstairs. Using the slave staircase (it's that old), which is the only way to get up to that part of the house when it's locked, they found the entire banquet room had been ransacked. When you try to go upstairs, you get a very unsettling feeling - the feeling of ""I don't want to go up there at all."" No business, restaurant or otherwise, has been successful at the Blakney house, or at least no business ever stays there for very long. The business located there today makes a point of closing before dark, as they are afraid to be in the building for ""when the fun begins.""",The Blakney House,North Carolina,NC,,,-80.5495112,34.9854275,True,False,2025/03/15,2,Night,Ghost (Male),Accident,"4,452",26.0,5.46,15.8%,5.4,7.0,1.8,4.6,56.0%,69.5%,56.3%,43.7%,82.7%,3.08%,115831.0,7.034,9.496,2.85,37930.57142857143,522.2142857142857,344583.5714285714,127.0,124.0,Much Above Average,334.0,73.0,47.0,148.0,62.0,72.0,32.0,11.83,The_old_Blakney_House_is_located_on_Franklin_St__B.png

Marion,United States,"Many different things occur at this particular cemetery. It is located off of Baker Church Road going toward Morganfield. You turn to the left off Baker Church Road on to Baker Hollow Road. There is one cemetery behind the church on the left. After you pass this church there is a fork in the road, follow it to the left and this is where everything begins. However on a good night it begins when you first turn on the road. You have to go after dark but the best time to go is around or after midnight. This cemetery disappears and then reappears in different locations. However it will not show itself when you drive down the road. You have to drive down to the end of the road and turn around and come back in order to see the cemetery. You will know when you are close to the cemetery because you will have an overwhelming feeling of sadness and will begin to cry for no apparent reason. You will see and hear various things. Sometimes you can hear music playing, laughter, screams and hear things trying to get in your vehicle. There have also been fingerprints and dents in vehicles visitors have taken `ut there as well as scratches that came from the outside but went all the way thought the glass. If you are actually lucky enough to find the cemetery and drive up in to it you will not be able to drive out. It is so spiritually active that it drains the battery of your car leaving you stranded until the morning or until you get brave enough to push your car out. There have been images of Soldiers killing each other and those around them. There have been sightings of the dense woods opening where you can see more than you should. The fork in the road rolls and a dense mist appears and disappears as you drive the road. There is also a guardian dog. This dog closely resembles the ""Hounds of Hell"" as described in the Bible. This dog has dead yellow eyes and casts the shadow of a demon when it gets ready to disappear in the triangle at the fork in the road. The dog appears to be injured when it first appears on the side of the road, thus making you want to stop and pick it up, which in turn gives an open invitation to any spirit that is around. When you fail to pick up the dog things begin to change. The dog will walk a few steps and then turn to see if you are still following it. However if you speed up the dog will speed up, if you slow down it will slow down, if you go to the left it will go to the left, if you go to the right it will go to the right and it is impossible to run over this dog. There have also been sightings of wrecked vehicles with people screaming for help. Due to the period in time when this cemetery was began you will see images of men who were hung from the trees out this road before and after you pass the cemetery. You will also see images of dead family members calling to you. You will also experience a change in the weather when you turn out this road. For instance it will be raining before you turn on the road, but when you turn on to this road the rain mysteriously stops and the mist begins until you exit this road where the rain will start again. There are many other things that occur out this road but you have to be very alert and very open to the spirit world and you cannot show fear or it can take your soul, according to the legend. There are many trapped souls at this location that will mess with you. Make sure you do not have an open invitation of any kind. This means windows rolled up and doors locked. These spirits can also communicate with you through your dreams if you will let them. So go if you dare just don't show fear!

Marion,United States,"Witches Grave - This cemetery is located off of Ford's Ferry Road in Marion. The legend behind this cemetery is about a five year old girl who was burned at the stake, along with her mother, in the late 1800's to the early 1900's for witchcraft. It is not known what happened to the body of the mother, however the little girl, Mary Evelyn, is buried in a steel lined grave that is covered with rock and not dirt. She has a white picket fence surrounding her grave. The base of this fence is a series of crosses that connect end to end. However she is not tall enough to climb over the fence, unlike a normal 5 year old. Her tombstone looks brand new even though it is close to 100 years old, as does the fence. She paces inside this fence when someone comes to visit her making faces at them and reaching out to them. She sleeps during the day but is very evident at night. The legend also says that she can not rest because she is searching for her mother but can not escape the confines of the fence. Many unexplainable things occur at this cemetery. For one the ""Watcher"" makes himself very know and tries to follow you out of the cemetery. The ""Watcher"" was murdered at the swinging bridge but haunts the witch’s grave. He is trying to get to the little witch but because of the crosses that surround her he is unable to because he is evil. Crosses appear in the trees both upright and upside down, directly over her grave, though they face different directions. She presents herself as a normal 5-year-old little girl in a white dress, though her dress is scorched at the bottom as is her blonde hair. If you lay on her grave she will hold you down refusing to let go until someone from outside of the fence pulls you free. However never lay on the grave when you are alone because chances are you will be pulled into her grave to be with her thus giving her more power. As with every haunted cemetery people that are open to the spirit world sees something different.",Pilot's Knobb,Kentucky,KY,-88.0679244,37.3692571,-88.0811349,37.3328286,False,True,2025/03/05,0,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"2,206",27.0,6.31,15.8%,5.7,8.8,1.9,5.0,40.2%,70.6%,53.5%,46.5%,83.7%,2.67%,59519.0,3.195,4.313,3.19,10717.857142857143,186.78571428571428,108398.21428571428,125.0,109.0,Above Average,354.0,87.0,45.0,106.0,43.0,55.0,19.0,11.83,Witches_Grave___This_cemetery_is_located_off_of_Fo.png

Park City,United States,"A spirit of the cave is a Southern lady named Melissa, who brought her Yankee lover to the cave in 1843. She took the man deep within the cave to Purgatory Point and left him there as a prank. The man was never seen again, and Melissa's ghost still searches the area known as Echo River. The ghost of Floyd Collins, who died after being trapped for sixteen days in nearby Crystal Cave, is also said to wander the grounds. The case became so popular that in 1926, Collins's body was removed from his family plot and displayed in a glass coffin at the entrance to Crystal Cave. The grisly tourist attraction proved very profitable, until someone stole the corpse. It was finally returned to the cave; however, for some reason the body was missing its left leg. In recent years, tourists have reported the unidentified ghost of a man dressed in an old-fashioned cummerbund.

Partridge,United States,"late at night you can here a loud whaling and screaming coming from the woods on Lewis creek. No one knows exactly what happened but their used to be a racetrack that everyone used to race cars on. It wasn’t pro or anything but it was fun for the guys mostly and their girlfriends would come to watch then race and one time there was a horrible accident and a car wrecked and went into the bleachers and killed more than 15 people and it is believed that the screams are from all the people that died that day. the track is still up there and the guard rails and what’s left of the bleachers is their too. the old buildings that the cars where sometimes kept in are still their too. Kids go up there and use it for paint ball games. People who live behind the area have experienced their roll up shades moving own their own, hearing voices whispering like at night. - June 2008 correction / additional information: The racetrack was known as Lonnie's Speedway and yes it's still there, not in good shape but still there. There was an accident that only the drivers were killed in, not 15 people. Every now and then, no certain time, you can sit on the blacktop road that runs beside the earth walls of the track and hear the wreck happen. There are no homes behind the track, it's all woods. There are houses on the creek past the track, as well as before you get to the track. If you want to find this track I'll tell you how. You go up Lewis Creek, off of US HWY 119 in Partridge. Cross the new state bridge just off 119, then go on up the holler. You'll cross a set of railroad tracks on your way to the track. You will come to a yard with a fairly large house off in the distance and an old barn just off the road; this is Lonnie Lewis' house, and barn. The Lonnie that lives in the house is also the Lonnie that the speedway was named after. The racetrack looks like just a hill, just off the road right past the barn on the left of the road. Make sure ask Lonnie's permission to go to the actual track because he is now old and might think that you're trying to steal something. His son also lives in a camper near the track, behind the barn.",Lewis Creek,Kentucky,KY,-82.9004223,37.0051826,-82.8979391,37.00648320000001,True,True,2025/05/13,2,Night,Other (Male),Murder,"2,206",27.0,6.31,15.8%,5.7,8.8,1.9,5.0,40.2%,70.6%,53.5%,46.5%,83.7%,2.67%,59519.0,3.195,4.313,3.19,10717.857142857143,186.78571428571428,108398.21428571428,125.0,109.0,Above Average,354.0,87.0,45.0,106.0,43.0,55.0,19.0,11.83,late_at_night_you_can_here_a_loud_whaling_and_scre.png

Rather you go in the day or night the same will happen because most occurrences happen once you reach the middle of the tunnel. The right tunnel is much more active than the left. NEVER go alone. Beware these tunnels are still in service and actual trains still pass through each day. One such aspect of the haunting place is the ghost train, which you will actually hear and even feel beneath your feet. Faint train horns echo throughout this terrifying area. Also feel free to explore the large active cemeteries above. Rumors are there many more horrifying things that have happened and continue to happen that cannot be mentioned in this article. - July 2005 Update/Warning: This may not be a safe place to visit.

Another guide had a small child on her tour remark about seeing babies in the house.

Winchester,United States,"There is a former medical clinic turned museum in downtown Winchester, Kentucky that seems to be haunted. The stories range from footsteps around, and above the listener to doors opening and closing themselves, and even sightings of full body apparitions of former clinic employees. Moving cold spots, fluctuating EMF readings, various orb photos, and such are common in the building especially on the third floor. There have been several very clear EVPs caught in and around the former operating room, and in various places on the third floor of the building, as well as in the former morgue area. The voices captured seem to be that of doctor and nurses talking just before, or during a surgery, and of a man screaming, and moaning in pain. Also, at least one home video exists of heavy footsteps walking, and then running across the floor above the listeners, and of a hallway door shutting itself, opening itself, and then slamming its self shut. The most compelling evidence this video holds is of a lock on the third floor hallway door unexplainably unlatching its self right before your eyes, and the door slowly opening. These events have been witnessed for decades, and by countless numbers of people and as before stated even exists on video.

Alma,United States,"The Alma Cemetery is haunted for two reasons. One is the people who are buried there and refuse to leave. Some pictures have been taken during the night up there. (It's the best time.) The pictures were unbeleivable, there were orbs and mist figures in the pictures. Reason two is the legend of the Devil's Chair. The story is that in the 1800s a real old mean farmer owned the land that is now the cemetery. About that same time Alma was being built. Towns officials had been trying to get him to sell his land so they could use it for the new town's cemetery. But he kept refusing to sell it. One day while at his well getting water someone came up from behind him and pushed him into the well. Than about a week later the town officials come out to the farm to try and to get him to sell again. And one of them noticed a smell from the well. The sheriff said it was nothing and ordered for the well to be boarded and locked and that no one is suppose to talk about. So the farmers land became the town's cemetery. Than in the 1980s some teens decided to go out there and see if they can see the ghost of the old man. One of the teens dared another to sit on top of the closed well. The teen did as he was dared, but suddenly the group heard a sound behind them and turned to see what it was and there was nothing there. So when they turned around to see if there friend was still sitting there. But he wasn't. Thinking that it was a joke he was playing they left and figured they'd see him tomorrow. But the teen was never seen again. Over the years there have been other stories of people sitting on the Devil's Chair and never being seen again. Some people say that it's the farmer reaching through the now old rotted broken boards and getting revenge on the town that took his land away from him. People call it the Devil's Chair because the man was evil when he was alive and is still evil after death.",Alma Cemetery,Kansas,KS,-96.2990179,39.016088,-96.2891624,39.0166657,True,True,2025/01/01,12,Night,Ghost (Male),Death,"1,146",25.5,5.13,16.7%,5.6,7.8,1.6,3.8,46.6%,70.4%,59.6%,40.4%,83.9%,3.14%,29230.0,2.076,2.802,2.94,10847.0,106.28571428571428,96924.14285714286,126.0,89.0,Below Average,340.0,93.0,9.0,152.0,23.0,54.0,11.0,11.83,The_Alma_Cemetery_is_haunted_for_two_reasons__One.png
Alma,United States,"Wabaunsee High School is the Haunted by past students and teachers. Most of the students groups are those of students who never got to graduate from the high school because they died while attending it. Teachers and even students have experienced strange things, which occur mostly on the third floor of the building. Things usually occur when someone is on the floor alone. One time the junior- senior class English teacher was alone in her classroom grading paper. Her door is right across the hall for the school’s auditorium and she noticed that the lights in auditorium were flickering on and off and there were voices coming from it. She thought that it was some students that had stayed in the building and were goofing off. So she went to check it but the door was locked, and the kept flickering. So she went to back to her classroom and got her key. As soon as she unlocked and opened the door the lights and the voices stopped. So she peaked in side but saw nothing. As she walked out she was stunned at what she saw, every single locker on the floor was wide open, even the ones that had padlocks on them. She slowly closed the auditorium door and locked it and as she was locking it all the locker doors slammed shut. She was so scared that she left the high school without locking her classroom door. Another time the same teacher was again grading papers by herself in her classroom. She suddenly heard music coming from the auditorium, so she grabbed her key went to the door unlocked it and opened it. She almost passed out at what she saw, she saw a ghostly looking lady playing an instrument.

Lawrence,United States,"Haskell is a know sight for countless paranormal activity. The campus itself dates back to the 1800's when the US Government built Haskell Institute to help control the Native American population and assimilate them into mainstream America. Native American children were taken from their reservations and sent to schools like Haskell to teach them how to be white Americans. All aspects of their Native American heritage was stripped from them and they were forced to act as the Government felt appropriate. Countless reports and documents held in the National Archives office in Kansas City tell stories of children beaten and abused for using their Native tongue, or for acting out of conduct. The University of Kansas forensic labs hold several remains of children found buried throughout the Haskell Campus. Many rumors are speculated about some of the Universities buildings, which are all some of the oldest in the state of Kansas. Haskell is an amazing place for those who seek an up and close experience with the paranormal. The history and horror that this campus holds is unlike any other place in the world.

Medicine Lodge,United States,"The story of this place has lived among the locals and not sure if it is fact or myth, however the story goes: In the early settlers days pioneers settled on flowertop mountain and they believed the indians were peaceful however one fateful day their opinion changed. The way this was discovered was through a riddle passed down through generations about a diary kept by a woman on that spot. The riddle was eventually solved and revealed a location of the supposed diary. The location was a gnarled tree at the top of flowertop and sure enough there stood a small dead tree that stood out from the rest. ""Historians"" dug up around the tree and found the diary. The woman talked about how the Indians were peaceful but the last entry out of nowhere stated. ""Indians Hostile"". It is along with the story that every settler was murdered and to this day that gnarled tree still stands. The odd thing about the tree is that it leans north and its branches point north while everything on the other side of it is dead, but the trees around it lean south and the north sides the dead or dieing branches. - **A few more points of interest about this place** It has been rumored that a cult was active in this very location back in the late 80s and early 90s and cows around the area were found dead with one thing wrong, their utters were sliced off, but not by animals because the cuts were too strait and clean.

Parsons,United States,"An explosion in the late 1980s killed two workers, a man and a woman, and closed the plant for more than two years. When work resumed in 1990, just in time for the Persian Gulf War, part of the building was closed. To prevent sympathetic detonation in case of an accident, work areas were located several hundred yards apart, connected by ramshackle, unpainted, wasp-infested wooden ramps. Inspectors, supervisors and parts managers rode old-fashioned bicycles with wire handlebar baskets between areas. They used thumb-operated bicycle bells to alert other bikers and ""pedestrians"" before crossing an intersection or entering an adjoining hallway. As production of the cluster bombs continued -- with 202 bombs tucked inside each one -- rumors spread that the workers killed by a single exploding bomblet was haunting the closed area of the plant. Only two of the employees who survived the explosion returned to the plant, but they each began to have nightmares about their former co-worker; one was being chased through the dark, wooden ramps by the woman, whose face was destroyed in the blast by flying shrapnel. The other survivor was plagued by visions of a male co-worker being vaporized from the waist up by the explosion, his legs, shielded by the thick steel work table, beginning to turn and run without its upper body. In the dreams, they kept running. Finally, one night two inspectors and a parts manager decided to explore the closed ramp. There were no lights in the area, and the workers hadn't thought to bring a flashlight. Still, they crept ahead into the dark. About 100 feet or so up the hall, the air cooled noticeably. The men walked a few feet further until, from around a bend ahead of them, they heard it: a metallic ringing. A bicycle bell rang twice in the pitch black, abandoned hall. Brrrng, brrrng! Then, after a pause, twice more: Brrrng, brrrng! The men, already nervous because of the dark and cold, fled back down the ramp to the light. After catching their breath, they agreed they had heard a bicycle bell, precisely the type bell used by the company's supervisors, inspectors, etc. for transportation in the labyrinthine plant. They agreed that the sound had come from ahead of them, not behind, and they agreed it wasn't likely anyone could have been in the ramp ahead of them with a bicycle.",Army Ammunition Plant,Kansas,KS,-95.1842132,37.2844919,-95.2610838,37.34033840000001,True,True,1990/03/13,2,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"1,146",25.5,5.13,16.7%,5.6,7.8,1.6,3.8,46.6%,70.4%,59.6%,40.4%,83.9%,3.14%,29230.0,2.076,2.802,2.94,10847.0,106.28571428571428,96924.14285714286,126.0,89.0,Below Average,340.0,93.0,9.0,152.0,23.0,54.0,11.0,11.83,An_explosion_in_the_late_1980s_killed_two_workers_.png

Brewster,United States,"There are several, seemingly, unrelated stories about this road which starts as Federal Hill Road in Brewster, New York and ends as Joe's Hill Road in Danbury, Connecticut. The most pronounced story is that of the Jesus Tree (cut down in the early 1990's). This tree with the image of Jesus on the crucifix was said to ""bleed"" a red substance from its trunk when they cut it down. There are twelve trees evenly spaced and equal in stature directly following where the Jesus Tree stood. These are said to be the twelve apostles. When you travel farther down the road (eastbound), you come to a very curious looking estate. this ominous looking estate is actually Morefar Golf Club. This is believed to be a cover for something else. Word of links to the Satanic church have been bantered about. The main entrance has a sign reading ""Back 'o Beyond"". Interesting welcome for a country club. Immediately following Morefar, and across the street is Farrington Pond. There have been several stories about people driving off the road, into the pond, claiming to have seen ""something"". The undifinitive story of this pond is that a young lady, on her way to a High School Prom, went off the road and into the pond. She was said to have drowned. When the moonlight hits the water, people have been known to see an image in a prom dress on top of the water, dancing - alone. In 1988, a young man named Dean, was found in his car on the side of the pond (just off the road), dead from gun shot wounds to the back of his head.

In 1950, ten years after the fire, the suspect who set the fire returned. He murdered the entire family the night before Halloween by stabbing them to death. The next evening, a group of teenagers came to the field to hang out. The young daughter, who had been able to escape the murderer, was going crazy looking for her family. The teens watched in horror as she ran to the water and dived in. She drowned instantly, since she was unable to swim. They reported the incident to the police.

She had no friends and her father built her a stone club house on the property for her to play. She liked animals and wuld play with them in her stone clubhouse. Supposedly she was possessed by a spirit and started mutilating the animals on a stone table in her clubhouse. Later on she killed her father and her brother with an axe. After the some time the townspeople went to see what had happened the the land owner and found her sleeping in her fathers bed with him covered in blood. They hung her on a tree on the property. The tree is there on the side of the road. It always looks dead all year long. The burn marks from her rope are on the tree branch. Up the hill is the house. You can see a figure sitting in the window looking down on the road. Now that part of the house is supposed to be blocked off. Her stone clubhouse is on the road just a bit further up.

The McGarrah Stagecoach Tavern Inn began its existence sometime between 1790 and 1800 and constitutes one of the oldest buildings in Monroe, N.Y. On of the common sightings is a man with top hat, dress in a dark suit wondering the rooms upstairs. A witness attempted to confront the ghost by running after him, but as he turned the corner, the ghostly man vanished. The man is described about 5ft, dress in a dark suit style in 1800 with top hot. You could hear his footstep as he walks back and forth on the second floor. The basement is truly a frightening experience. Every time we went down stars the temperature dropped at least 15 degrees. EMF went wild, as you get closer to the fireplace. As the hairs on the back of my neck reacted to chills, you can actually feel ghostly pressure surrounding you.

Newburgh,United States,"The story goes... There is a rather large building, in which is now know Plum Point condo's, in Newburgh NY that used to be a all boys Christian school. One of the nun's molested the boy & killed him then put his body in the wall and covered it up well (being there was already construction going on inside it was a good cover-up, he was just reported missing) Then about a year later strange things would happen that drove the school to shut down. For about 10 or more years now they have been trying to make it into an apartment complex because there are condo's all around it, and every time someone goes in there to work, a hand was cut off by machinery, the machinery would break for no apparent reason, etc..

It was originally constructed for a family who met an untimely death. The mansion then became a home for wayward girls for many years and eventually an orphanage of sorts, accepting children who were not only parentless, but had no where to run.

Oyster Bay,United States,"The home was originally owned by the Townsend family. The house was used as a base for the British during the Revolutionary War. John Andre was a British Major during the war and visited often. One day Townsend's daughter overheard Andre and John Simcoe (Commander of British Forces) talking about a payment to Benedict Arnold to surrender his troops. The Townsends relayed this information to George Washington. Benedict Arnold escaped, but Andre was captured and hanged. His ghost was first reported here in the 1930s when he was seen on horseback outside a bedroom window. John Andre isn't the only ghost here. Sally Townsend, allegedly John Simcoe's lover is said to still haunt the house. Her former bedroom is always cold, even in the summer the curator wears a warm wool vest in that room! Paranormal investigators have said that whatever is in that room is not happy. In October of 1999 a volunteer was working on the property when the garden door opened and a man came out wearing a dark wool coat with brass buttons. First it was strange to see someone wearing that clothing, second the building was locked, and third the alarms were all on! In march another worker saw the same ghost materialize by the staircase. Once with the bottom half of his body missing, and then again full-figure. The ghost is believed to be Michael Conlin, an Irish immigrant who worked as a servant in the 1860's. In the upstairs of the former servants quarters moving shadows have been seen when no one else is in the house. In that same area the smell of roses has mysteriously been sensed. The spirit of a servant woman has materialized and walked into the kitchen. In that kitchen the smell of apple pie has also been present when ghosts want to make themselves known. The submitter was extremely privileged when they smelled the strong scent of cinnamon-apple on their way down the stairs near the kitchen. When they got down to the bottom of the stairs they could smell the strong scent of something like cinnamon rolls or apple pie! Another area that is said to produce some interesting smells is the front foyer. The smell of a non-existent stove has been sensed there as well as the faint smell of a smoking pipe. At one time this was the kitchen area. The former museum director Andrew Batten says he has sensed at least 5 different entities and something in Sally Townsend's room.",Raynham Hall,New York,NY,-73.5316101,40.8724113,-73.5358541,40.7893778,True,True,0400/03/13,1,Night,Ghost (Male),Suicide,"6,701",23.8,4.18,17.6%,5.4,7.1,1.6,3.7,44.2%,67.2%,63.3%,36.7%,86.4%,2.03%,159338.0,16.33,22.046,3.08,82598.28571428571,820.7857142857143,395281.0,128.0,125.0,Much Above Average,1029.0,494.0,256.0,27.0,68.0,79.0,105.0,11.83,The_home_was_originally_owned_by_the_Townsend_fami.png

Poughkeepsie,United States,"The ghost of former Rector, Dr. Alexander Griswold Cummings has been reported here many times since his death in the late 1940s or early 50s. While he was still living, he did not like using candles, so candles used during services were repeatedly blown out. At one point, a bat materialized in the church, then disappeared. In the 1970s, Bishop James Pike, Rector at the time, scared the ghost away from the sanctuary by bringing his dog into the church. After that, Alexander remained quiet for a while. In the 1990s, Alexander surfaced again. This time, it was because current Rector, the Rev. Michael Phillips, decided to move the Rector's office to a different location in the building. The move outraged the ghost, and for years afterwards, the old rector's office (now the library) would be freezing cold in the mornings, even during the spring. Eventually, the ghost went back into hiding. Another ghost is the spirit of an elderly lady, who died in the middle of a service sometime in the 1910s.

Old books were in one of the rooms upstairs, burst into flames.- January 2004 update/correction - these caves are right below hotel hell. you will hear moaning as of creatures or monsters there. Witnesses have heard laughing, have seen a little girl in a black dress wearing no shoes on the stairs which go into the caves area. you can hear singing there day or night. near the old stables, visitors have been chased by white light which some of them have seen as a carriage drawn by white horses. also in the old stables the sounds of horses hooves have been heard. The submitter of the update has done some research into hotel hell and it may never have been owned by Al Capone. the first thing to be built there was a ""resort"" built in the 1800's which was one of those places where people went to be cleansed by the natural spring water which still runs pure and clear there today. when you walk the trails there (it's still open to the public) there is one cave door which has been partially opened due to a rockslide, spring water still runs there.","Maribel Caves/ Maribell Hotel ""Motel Hell""",Wisconsin,WI,-87.7738952,44.2862983,-87.8073129,44.276383,True,True,2004/01/13,4,Night,Other (Male),Unknown,"2,651",24.2,5.75,25.8%,5.5,7.5,1.7,3.8,51.4%,68.4%,63.2%,36.8%,86.1%,2.30%,64214.0,4.453,6.011,2.19,14619.8,170.73333333333332,145743.53333333333,126.0,119.0,Near Average,289.0,145.0,44.0,33.0,17.0,22.0,28.0,11.83,An_old_abandoned_building_owned_by_Al_Capone_close.png

On how she died is speculation. One account says she fell in love with one of the lumberman, became pregnant and killed herself. Another is, she died during child birth. Another is she died from flu brought by the white man. The chief buried her on the hill, and cursed the ground that it would never do any white man any good. The curse is the legend. Nine people died after T.B. Scott bought the land for a home in 1884 and died unexpectedly in 1886 before the house was finished. Within a year his wife Ann died. Their son Walter went to see the architect to finish the house. He was stabbed to death by him. In 1893 it was sold to a man named Kuechle. He lost all his money on a gold mine and mortgaged the house to Tony Barsanti. Tony foreclosed and Kuechle went insane and died in an asylum. The same year Barsanti was stabbed to death in Chicago while waiting for a train to Merrill. In 1901, George Gibson bought the house and went to inspect it. He was never seen again. In 1906, Mary Fellhaber bought the property. Soon after fell ill and died. Popcorn Dan was the caretaker and died in 1912 after booking passage on the Titanic.The next caretaker Mr. Lloydsen died of alcoholism. In 1919 the widower of M. Fellhaber gave the property to the city. In 1923 the city gave it to the Sisters of the Holy Cross who have seemed to break the curse for now.

Spooner,United States,"Railroad and newspaper man Frank Hammill is generally regarded as the ”Father of Spooner.” He arrived in 1883 on the Chicago Northwestern Railroad. He later became publisher of the Spooner Advocate, mayor of the town, and a prominent Republican politician. Hammill died suddenly in 1922 of a mysterious stomach problem. His body was displayed in the beautiful house he had built for himself and his family. His wife lived the remainder of her days there and often reported felling that Frank was still there with her. As time passed and new owners took over, the house gained a reputation of being haunted. Frank, said the owners, was still in “his” house, watching over “his” town. Most reported hearing noises, voices, and feeling that they simply were not alone in the old house -- one family even moved out. Today the apparent hauntings continue, and the current residents are absolutely certain they are not alone. They even refer to their “guest” as Frank.",Hammill House,Wisconsin,WI,,,-91.8893431,45.8224475,True,True,1883/03/13,1,Unknown,Ghost (Male),Death,"2,651",24.2,5.75,25.8%,5.5,7.5,1.7,3.8,51.4%,68.4%,63.2%,36.8%,86.1%,2.30%,64214.0,4.453,6.011,2.19,14619.8,170.73333333333332,145743.53333333333,126.0,119.0,Near Average,289.0,145.0,44.0,33.0,17.0,22.0,28.0,11.83,Railroad_and_newspaper_man_Frank_Hammill_is_genera.png
