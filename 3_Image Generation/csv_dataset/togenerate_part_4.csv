Norfolk,United States,"As strange as it sounds for a U.S. Navy ship to be haunted with a little girl, that appears to be what is happening. One of the few things on the GW. Multiple people have said that they have seen her in the lower levels of the Engineering spaces. One saw her in a pink and white dress. Another saw her in a blue dress and when he tried to get closer she was gone. Another sailor said that he had seen a guard dog on one of his tours, but the dog disappeared as soon as he got closer to it. There have been reports of strange noises, like the sound of someone jingling their keys as they walk down the stairs but there is no one on the stairs. One time a man walked halfway down the stairs but never made it to the bottom. Two gentlemen standing near watched him start his journey before he disappeared. Another group of men have seen a man walking through equipment before going out of sight. Once they investigated they found no one in the space.

When construction began several appearances had been sighted of children running around and giggling in the woods. Machinery started to malfunction and people started to disappear in the woods when bodies of the children had been found in unmarked stone graves around the houses. The area of land is located across from the junkyard that sits across the street from the original orphan house all the way to the forest miles behind and next to Potomac library.

Lapwai,United States,"it is a two story, red brick building, with a 100 x 50 foot courtyard in the middle. It is located on the west side of an open field, which is about the size of a football field. Directly across from this building (on the eastern-most side) used to stand an identical building, which burned down about 20 years ago. Finally, on the northern-most part of the field is another building, which was part of the other two, which has since been remodeled into the local school districts office. The point behind all of this, is that these buildings were once used as offices, dormitory's and also a TB hospital and sanitarium by the U.S. Calvary during the early settlement days. This area was called ""Ft. Lapwai"". The building has now been remodeled-extensively- and contains a total of 11 head start classes, with 4 of those classes for the ages of 0-3 years. it is these downstairs, baby rooms that have some of the most ""activity"" one particular incident occurred about a year ago, conveniently around Halloween!

Some blew out on their own. The ones that didn't blow out didn't burn when you put your hand in the flame. There was wailing that started from stage right and moved inhumanly fast to stage left.

Durham,United States,"Hannah is her name. This descendant of Valentine Hill is believed to be the home's most restless spirit. Over the years we have found Hannah to be quite fond of electronics and to enjoy playing hide and seek with a variety of inordinate objects. It is believed that Hannah does not like change and makes this very well known when new equipment with a power cord is brought on to the property. This often times has forced the Inn to seek outside assistance with help for something as simple today as a new computer or copy machine which has stumped our vendors as to why certain items will not properly work. The numbers have appeared backwards on a calculators ten key. While printing one page from a computer several pages have began printing even after the computer and printer were turned off and unplugged leaving the printer without power continuing to print for nearly twenty minutes until the paper was gone.  Hannah has a special affection towards some of the Inns employees. The Inn is staffed 24 hours a day therefore the Inn has an employee stay overnight. On one occasion, an employee was sleeping to be awoken by someone playing with her hair. Aware that Hannah is often around, she simply tucked her hair into her nightgown and told Hannah to go to bed. On another occasion another employee was fast asleep, again, awoken by the sound of someone walking around our front parlor. Quickly the employee went downstairs and found every drawer in the armoire, desk and filing cabinet pulled out by exactly one inch. On occasion Hanna has shown herself. One evening a former Chef was working in the food and beverage office late into the evening. Shortly after 1:00am the Chef locked the office and was making way up the stairs from the Tavern to leave when a movement happened. Below the staircase is a railing that looks behind the bar. In looking down to see what the movement was the Chef was shocked to see Hannah standing behind the bar area looking up at the Chef. Often times locks with deadbolts have a way of locking themselves while no one is near. While a party from a local insurance company were dining in our Maples dining room during the holiday season the entire party witnessed a glass from a table across the room where not a sole was near, pick itself up off the table and smash against the side of the table to land in pieces on the floor.  Much of the Staff and Guests alike have witnessed the shadow, face, touch or vintage clothing of this magnificent woman named Hannah. Given the history of the Inn it is believed that several spirits other than Hannah reside in this home today. Guest have made mention of footsteps and moving furniture above their heads during the night while there were not any guest above them to have made any sounds.",The Three Chimneys Inn,New Hampshire,NH,-70.9188133,43.1321608,-70.9264393,43.1339545,True,True,2025/03/24,2,Night,Ghost (Male),Death,661,25.6,5.91,18.3%,5.5,7.6,1.5,4.0,55.5%,69.7%,59.9%,40.1%,85.2%,1.66%,16902.0,0.9599,1.296,1.24,2244.5,14.928571428571429,27821.0,128.0,124.0,Much Above Average,39.0,15.0,14.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,11.83,Hannah_is_her_name__This_descendant_of_Valentine_H.png

After that they figured it wouldn't happen again. Miners claim to have seen figures in windows looking out at them. They describe the figure as a middle-aged man with a trucker hat. His skin is a dark gray. In some cases miners have heard a screeching sound and then seeing flashes of gray and black and a high-pitched scream. Also, miners claim to have been hit hard across the head with a hard rock. BUT it is a good idea to go to the mine. ?",Ghost Town,Idaho,ID,-115.925534,47.471669,-115.9279386,47.4740945,True,True,2025/05/13,1,Night,Other (Male),Accident,732,24.8,5.31,16.0%,5.8,9.1,2.0,4.5,43.6%,68.6%,60.8%,39.2%,85.9%,3.01%,18119.0,1.138,1.536,2.19,3504.214285714286,31.214285714285715,34557.642857142855,99.0,119.0,Near Average,12.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,11.83,In_the_old_mine_there_was_a_big_rock_fall_in_1890_.png

Wilmington,United States,"Averill Stand Historic Site was built in 1787, and was for many years the stagecoach stop between Bennington and Brattleboro on what is now Route 9. The Averill family managed the stagecoach stand on the site, hence the name Averill Stand, as well as the tavern and Inn. The family cemetery is on a small plot of land adjacent to the old pasture, and contains the bodies of many of the house's former occupants. One of those, Lavina Field Averill, is believed to have died in childbirth in the home, and it' is thought that she may be the spirit who has, several time, placed missing items on the kitchen counter. One visitor reports having seen a young woman in old clothing in the dining room. At night, always between 10:30 and 11:40, the current occupant's dogs run to the back door, barking, and watch someone or something, cross the back yard and walk to the old driveway. Some unseen being repeatedly rings the doorbell on snowy nights, leaving no trace of human footsteps. Perhaps it is Lavina, or perhaps it's Mrs. Brown, the wife of former lumber baron Martin Brown, who lived in the home for many years in the early 1900's, and died there.

Tonopah,United States,"Charles M. Keller, principal from January 1985 - June 1992, learned of strange happenings when he arrived for duty - lights going off for no reason during the day and strange things at night.  Teachers working late or at night would have feelings that someone was watching them, strange rapping sounds, and one teacher saw an apparition of a man. Mr. Keller wrote a ghost story called, ""Jake, The Ghost"", as a Halloween story for the children, teachers, and staff in 1985.  The story brought forth more reports of strange behavior from the staff.  One teacher working late one evening heard scuffing footsteps coming down the hall toward her classroom. When she investigated she saw nothing but the steps were still coming toward her!  She was so scared she climbed out the window, ran across the street to one of the neighbors and called her husband for help!  It was not until the summer of 2006 Mr. Keller learned the identity of the ghost. He is a writer of children's poems and stories and wanted further research on his story of the ghost.  In September 1903 there was a Chinese race riot.  The local labor union for some reason decided to run all the Chinese people out of town.  During the riot a Chinese man by the name of Ping Ling was badly beaten and hit over the right eye with a hatchet.  He decided to walk out of town and leave the area.  He bled to death on the road. That road now is the same one that is between Silver Rim School and the Mormon LDS Church. Silver Rim School was not built until 1980. Where the ghost of Ping Ling was until that time is uncertain. Why he chose to take up residence of the school is another mystery. Mr. Keller is certain Ping Ling means no harm to the people in the building.  He is not seen or heard during the day when there are activities in the school. But at night he is quite active and curious. However, Mr. Keller made many trips back to the school at night, especially during the winter, to check security and the heating system. He never encountered Ping Ling on any of his trips. He could only surmise Ping Ling respected him.",Silver Rim Ele.

In fact, up in the Brigham City Valley, there is a ""B"" on the Mountain for Box Elder and though faded, the ""I"" is still present as well. the school also served as a Hospital for wounded soldiers during WWII. As a precautionary measure there were many underground tunnels that were built to support the likes of an evacuation. Today many of the buildings have been remade into apartment housing and also are rented out as storage, but some are still closed to the public and are not being used for anything. The tunnels were boarded up at the end of the war. Today the buildings not in use stand deserted and boarded up. Kids from the area go inside sort of like a dare. Upon one of these instances it was discovered that the tunnels that were once boarded up now stand open to those daring enough to go inside. One of the rooms you can get to by use of the tunnels has been used for satanic rituals. Blood hangs on the walls; there is a pot in the corner and an ""alter"" in the middle of the room. Another room has paintings of demonic clowns with knives and other sharp objects painted on the walls. there have been speakers and lecturers brought in to speak on the subject at the college. One speaker said that Northern Utah was 2nd in the nation among Satan worshiping among teenagers. It is verified by police there is some sort of human activity and they warn not to go up there.

However, the Photo Building is haunted. Most activity occurs at night or after hours, when the building is quiet. There is a long history of this building being haunted, going back 30 years or more. The haunting is not harmful, just unsettling. Running feet, indistinct whispering, unintelligible talking at a distance and footsteps are heard. No reports of missing or moving objects. A few instances of very loud crashes, like a wall full of items fell to the floor. Upon investigation, nothing is found. One photographer saw a fleeting figure run out of the old developing room, across the hallway and into a cinder block wall. Figure was tall, black pants, white shirt and dark hair. Matches description of a photographer who died of natural causes at home years ago. Speculation that he's back, because he enjoyed working there so much. All activity occurs in the front half of the building, which is the oldest. An addition was built in the early 1980s, doubling the size of the building. No activity reported in this new addition. The older, front portion of the building is scheduled to be refurbished in the near future. This will mean tearing out some walls, redoing the rooms and a major makeover.

Salt Lake City,United States,"Built in 1926-27, it has been haunted for many years. Quite a few years ago, while cleaning out some old storage rooms, an urn was found with the ashes of a Charles Valentine. Some inquiries were made and it was found that Charles was a Mason. No one knows why the ashes were not buried at the time of his death, but they were eventually returned to be buried correctly. Since that time strange things happen in this lovely old building.

Omaha,United States,"""The Regular"" Bill Wolcott was an older gentleman who, for years, dined at Brother Sebastian's almost every evening. Wolcott had his peculiarities: he often dressed in a formal smoking jacket complete with an ascot tie; he always dined in the lounge, always at the same seat. Unfortunately, Wolcott was stricken with cancer. Although treatments were painful he continued to dine at Brother Sebastian's, even while he was hospitalized. When Wolcott became so ill that he could no longer swallow solid food, the kitchen staff pureed his meals for him. At some point during this time Wolcott began draping a towel over his head while he was in public; but for some reason he was drawn to his favorite dining spot. Wolcott, it appears, felt so comfortable at Brother Sebastian's that he continues to frequent the restaurant even after his death. The last report of Wolcott's ghost occurred on the night of the restaurant’s grand re-opening. A woman seated in one of the back dining rooms complained that someone was staring at her and making her uncomfortable. The ""Someone"" to whom she referred was the face of an old man that the woman claimed was in the stones that make up the wall of the room. Two of the staff also witnessed, late one night after the restaurant was closed and all the doors were locked. They were the only people inside, they saw a swinging door at the rear of the bar open fully, stopped moving as if someone were walking through the threshold, and closed. Anyone who has been inside the building knows that a random wind breezing through to swing doors open and closed is unlikely: Just like the original building (before the 1995 fire), the new structure has no windows. Sometimes in restaurants an employee closes the establishment one night and opens the business the following morning. More than one server has stated that a candle that they knew was snuffed out the previous night was burning the next morning.",Brother Sebastian's,Nebraska,NE,-96.0990745,41.2458333,-95.9979883,41.2523634,False,True,1995/03/13,2,Morning,Ghost (Male),Accident,720,24.2,4.87,22.5%,5.6,8.0,1.7,3.9,52.1%,68.2%,66.1%,33.9%,85.4%,30.60%,17435.0,1.167,1.575,2.17,5176.642857142857,53.35714285714285,56289.07142857143,125.0,89.0,Below Average,307.0,159.0,4.0,93.0,13.0,34.0,5.0,,_The_Regular__Bill_Wolcott_was_an_older_gentleman.png

Omaha,United States,"In Omaha, there is a city park on the northern outskirts named Hummel Park. The background of this park is very macabre to begin with. In the early 1900's, Lynch mobs would ride through town and hang or otherwise mutilate any black people that happened to be in sight. They hung so many black people that the trees still bow over the road leading to Hummel Park. The weird part is that young trees and even the grass lean toward the road outside the park and even inside the park. Apparitions, mists, Indian drums playing at night, wolves howling. Supposed old Indian burial grounds on sight. Also, reports of the morphing stairs. It is a staircase which is roughly 200 stairs long. The word, ""roughly"" is used because every time you go up and or down it you will count a different number of stairs. There is a staircase at Hummel Park that if you walk up to the top and count the stairs going up, it will be less than the number of stairs going down, it is called the stairway to hell because of this. There have been many reports of animal sacrificing in the park. There is also a cult of albinos that live in the park, supposedly. But be careful of crazy people out there if you decide to go. - October 2007 Update: Parts of the steps are missing and falling apart so your count will always be different.

Omaha,United States,"At Omaha South High School, there is a ghost. The ghost's name is Gus. About 20-25 years ago there was a tornado drill. So everyone had to go to the ""Catacombs"" as we call them. This was a part of the building that was built when the performing arts part of the building was built. It was the 50's so it was built, to be a nuclear fallout shelter. Well during this tornado drill everyone went down to the catacombs. Gus, a janitor for the Performing Arts part of the building, thought that they would be there for a while. So he went to the ""Rat Room"" to get some provisions for everyone. He closed the door behind him, went to get a barrel of food, when it fell on him, and crushed his head. He was not found until he had been dead for a while. Now Gus still roams the Performing Arts section of the building, even after it was remolded about 10 years ago. The strange thing is that if you are in a play there and you don't believe in Gus he will mess you up.

Braselton,United States,"The older employees at Town Hall will talk about ""Little John"" inhabiting the house.  Town Hall operates out of what used to be a residence built in approximately 1910 by of one of the Braseltons.  The place later because a boarding house/hotel, an event house for weddings and then eventually the city renovated it in the late 90's and used to it to house its town hall, police department and water utility office. Older employees talk about things being moved, odd knocking and footsteps on the stairwell after the close of business, and opening up the business in the morning to find closed/locked desk drawers opened.  Most recently, two employees were standing in the upstairs landing in broad daylight talking when they heard an odd knocking coming from one of the interior closets near the window that is near the attic. One of the police department canines visibly refuses to enter a downstairs conference room that was originally a formal dining room. Little John was at first thought to be some sort of myth created by one of the former patrol division members to delight and scare the female staff members, but some current and some retired employees can tell of the oddities that have sometimes occurred in the house.  ""Little John"" was supposedly a son of one of the Braseltons that had some slight mental problems. Little John allegedly occupied the house for a while and used to pick up stray dogs as pet.  He and the dogs mostly resided in the attic until his death. Although rarely talked about, there is also a report of one of the former Braselton matrons being seen in the downstairs bathroom. Prior to the house becoming the Town Hall, it was sometimes used for wedding receptions and other events. Supposedly, a guest at one of the weddings proclaimed to be a psychic and he told of seeing people dressed in formal attire from the twenties standing in the hall and of seeing the Braselton female in and around the bathroom. Being that no harm ever seems to be done, some of the employees just laugh when things occur and write it off as Little John being in the house.

In the days before there was a mountain campus, students from Berry would go up into the woods to fool around. One such couple who attended Berry in the '40's is the subject of a tragic accident that occurred at Berry. After making love, the young man and young woman got into an argument, and the boy left his girlfriend in the woods to walk home alone while he drove. After driving a little while, he felt sorry and turned around to pick her up. On the way back, he wasn't paying attention to the road and he hit something. Assuming it was a deer, he got out to look--and it was his lover! She was dead.

Savannah,United States,"This Inn was built in 1790 and is haunted by a girl named Anna She was a seventeen year old girl who was shunned after getting pregnant by a sailor. The sailor was said to have jumped out of the third story window and died. He haunts the same room the window was located. Guests claim to lose things such as wallets, ID's, and underclothes. They will later be found in planters or behind bookshelves. People have also reported hearing Anna in the room moving things around. -  December 2003 Update/ Correction: The story is that she was in love with a sailor, but HE did NOT jump from the window... SHE DID. (He had gone to sea and was not there to throw himself out of a window) She was deeply depressed because he was going to sea and leaving her, most likely never to return. It is said that she could see the sails of his boat as it went down river and out to sea. She threw herself from a 3rd floor window. There is also said to be a woman who haunts the kitchen in the inn who used to practice voodoo, and a spirit haunts the bar/restaurant area. The submitter claims to have taken photos throughout the inn, but have not caught any anomalies on film. However, when they tried taking pictures in the bar area, their camera suddenly failed to work. Once they left the area, the camera functioned with no problem. They also had to buy new batteries twice in one weekend, as if something had drained them. On the second floor a linen closet, they felt a foreboding presence. Later, when talking to a housekeeper at the inn, they were told she had had a dream once of a man clad in 1700's clothing coming out of that same closet. She had no idea that they had a really creepy feeling each time they walked by it. The second time they stayed at the 1790's they remarked to the clerk as they checked in, that at least they weren't going to have to sleep in ""Anna's room"". The clerk told them that the window she threw herself from was not actually her bedroom at the time... her bedroom was room 101... which is the room they was staying in! When they reached the room and preceded to unlock the door, it wouldn't open. Both she and her husband tried, the bottom lock was unlocked, but the deadbolt wasn't. They had knocked on the door, jokingly saying, ""Anna... come on, open up."" They returned to the innkeeper and she went up with us to check out the problem. She informed them that the deadbolts could only be locked from the inside and the innkeeper has a master key for those. She pushed down on the door handle and the door opened with no problem! It was if the deadbolt had never been locked, yet they BOTH knew that it had been. The 1790's Inn (is actually spelled out as Seventeen Hundred Ninety's Inn, in case you want to search the net for it) is most definitely filled with an atmosphere of spirits from the past, you can feel it all around you if you are sensitive to that kind of thing.

Nacogdoches,United States,"Mays Hall 11 - Before the building was a dormitory, it was a hospital, with a morgue in the basement. On the other end of the building is a deep, ruined bomb shelter from the early 40s ar 50s. In the basement is a very negative feeling, very hard to describe. It is usually locked, but occasionally residents break in and wander around. It is mild there though. The bomb shelter has been locked for years but last year was broken into. Recently we discovered what appears to be a false wall in there, because the lining on the wall ends (no one noticed before because of the lighting and the junk all over the floor).. The negative feeling from the basement is present in the bomb shelter too, but grows as you near the false wall. Dorm residents are curious to explore but don't want to get caught. No one knows any specific stories, but we all speculate it would have to deal with someone dying in one fo the hospitalrooms. No ideas about what's behind the false wall, though. - Febuary 2005 Correction:there was never a morgue. The first floor of the original wing was the campus clinic which did have a couple of overnight observation rooms, but the city hospital was (and still is) less than half a mile away and the campus clinic was never used for long term care. The clinic closed when the ""short wing"" was built in the 60's, and the clinic was renovated into rooms (which is why those rooms resemble the short wing rooms more than the rooms above.

Nacogdoches,United States,"""Chester"" haunts the theater building on the Stephen F. Austin University campus. Reputed to be the ghost of the architect who died before the building's completion--some think the blueprints were misinterpreted and the building was erected backwards. Other people believe that ""Chester"" is the ghost of a former drama student. He has been seen as a face on a stage curtain and even once appeared onstage as an extra ghost in a play in the 1960's. Students have reported cold spots and strange noises in the halls of the building.  November 2003 update/correction: Chester was the architect of the building. When learning his plans were set backwards, he killed himself in disgrace. Chester was seen originally in a photo of the original theatre cast of Hamlet. With the actor playing the ""ghost"" in Hamlet sick, the director found the only person who knew the lines. When the cast picture was taken that night, only a faint glow comes from where the ghost portraying the character was standing. Members were dumbfounded.

San Antonio,United States,"Caribbean Apartments - Now known as the Willow Run apartments. These apartments have been in business for over 60 years. Before they were turned into apartments, it was a Motel business. The doors were painted in light yellow and blue pastels. Existing in what used to be the outskirts of town and just outside of Castle Hills, it would bring many customers of all races and origins. It was during this time that a rape and murder occurred in the North end of the complex. Every now and then in the middle of the night a woman's cry can be heard in the rear hallways. And in one of the apartment units, a suicide where a single mother overdosed on pain medication leaving her two year old to fend for herself. The child eventually died of starvation. The mother's body was found on the bed. The child's body was found on the floor next to the bed. It is unknown whether the overdose was accidental or intentional. When this particular apartment is empty the occupants of the downstairs apartment can hear the pitter patter of little feet walking up and down the upstairs unit. On occasion, a woman can be heard crying. Loud thumps can also be heard. Lights turn on and off by themselves and the toilet will flush on it's own. An occupant of the downstairs apartment noted that her young daughter told her ""she was playing with a little girl"". Believing that the child had an imaginary playmate, the mother discounted her little daughter's claims. Until one evening while the mother was sitting in the living room watching TV and her little girl was playing in the hallway with a small toy, she saw her daughter toss the small toy across the hallway into the front bedroom. The door had been left open. Then she heard her daughter talk to this imaginary friend to ""give it back"". To the mother's surprise, something or someone tossed the small toy back to her daughter. The mother kept watching and realized that there really was ""someone or something"" there. On another occasion while sleeping, she felt the touch of little fingers playing with her toes or gently tugging at her blankets. The apartment where the ""suicide"" took place is constantly vacant.

Libby,United States,"During the spring of the year, when thunderstorms are rumbling overhead, and lightning flashes lighting up the dark midnight sky, a shadow of a figure looking down, wearing what looks like a hooded poncho that is blowing, and waving in the wind, can be seen drifting (floating with no feet) around the RV Park. Before the RV Park was built, in the late 1960s with anticipation, and the start of construction on the Libby Dam, this place was called the Riverside Inn. It was a steak house, gas station, mobile home park, and mobile motel (house of ill repute). Construction workers and others gathered here after work to let loose, and do who knows what else. It is said that vagrants, and squatters called the Riverside Inn home. They camped in the woods behind the Inn with hopes of landing a job on the Dam.

Victoria,United States,"At Cinema 4 there is a ghost woman that watches the workers clean. She is very playful and likes to call you name. While looking down they have seen a little boy run up to the concession stand and when you look up no one it there. At all the theatres everyone has seen trash cans roll up ramps and cold spots through out the buildings. The ghost only seems to mess with you if there is nothing ""fun"" going on. - June 2008 Additional information: A Former employee that worked there in 1994 and 1995 as a projectionist. The story is that a woman named Dorothy fell out of an upstairs door that they used to load food and candy before the theater was bought by Cinemark. Apparently she broke her neck and died. The doors are still there, but have been padlocked shut. There is a 25 foot drop-off straight to the ground outside if you stepped through the door. When he worked there, you could say ""Dorothy"" and a film would always break within the next few minutes. They would always hear foot steps on the upstairs catwalk when we first entered the building in the morning when nobody was in the building. They would often see reflections of things in the windows in front of the projectors, but nothing was there when we turned around to look. Also, she enjoyed turning off lights, unscrewing light bulbs, and closing all the doors when you were upstairs alone.","Cinema 4, Salem 6, Playhouse 4",Texas,TX,,,-97.0035982,28.8052674,True,True,2025/03/04,2,Morning,Ghost (Male),Death,"10,647",25.8,4.9,17.6%,5.6,9.0,1.8,4.1,44.2%,71.1%,56.9%,43.1%,81.9%,3.97%,274633.0,18.821,25.408,2.69,117468.57142857143,1298.7857142857142,950400.7142857144,123.0,111.0,Above Average,115.0,35.0,20.0,22.0,9.0,21.0,8.0,11.92,At_Cinema_4_there_is_a_ghost_woman_that_watches_th.png

Waco,United States,"Baylor Residential - Formerly listed as Brooks Hall - At Baylor University, the oldest college in the state of Texas, exists a mysterious phantom on the abandoned fifth floor of the oldest dorm on campus. Violin music is heard in the dead of night and chilling sightings of a cloaked figure in top hat and cloak staring down and illuminated by an eerie candlelight have been widely reported by spooked residents. Investigations have wielded little fact but the enormous amount of eyewitness accounts and spine tingling sightings have given the legend a grand following. One night the shattering of glass was reported as the phantom peered down and paused his playing and in a fit of apparent rage struck a window. Come morning when level heads prevailed and the storm of the previous night had passed, no damage was found. Still the unpredictable toiling of the phantom have attracted audiences in the witching hour in hopes of catching a glimpse of the mysterious floating candlelight that often hovers from room to room and then vanishes only to appear in the other wing of the building. One unsettling account recollects the viewing of a noose and dangling of a shadowy corpse after the phantom finished the evening’s mournful serenade. Still more haunting is the episode on record of the lights failing the building and an ungodly tapping and cold sensation filtrating the respective doors of the fourth floor of the building. Only one resident dared investigate the unwelcome visitors calling. It is claimed that he peered into pitch darkness to find the horrific silhouette of a cloaked figure in a top hat turn and stare him down through the darkness and calmly vanish out of sight as he glided parallel down the corridor, needless to say it was not pursued. The university has failed to satisfy rumors of hauntings and has downplayed the events for close to half a century now. The Victorian styled villain who roams the corridors of the uninhabited floor and occasionally mingles with the living loves to make an entrance, the hoax is to elaborate for any collegiate prankster and the tradition has endured for too long. Perhaps the only explanation is that the phantom is ultimately unexplainable. - October 2007 Update – This old hall was recently torn down.

Andrews,United States,"Just north of Andrews, Texas, west of Highway 385, is the original location of the county seat of Andrews County, Shafter.

Up until about ten years ago, the cemetery where the victims were buried was located on the near edge of the small lake (which comes and goes as it pleases), but the bodies were moved and reentered elsewhere. Legend was that a ""lady in white"" haunted the graveyard, possibly the reason for its removal. Sometime during the fall of the year, you may also see a troop of Confederate soldiers and their horses galloping across the lake, usually during a full moon. Most think it is General Shafter and his men, who did patrol that area before it was settled, trying to escape Comanche Indians pursing them. By the way, the lake wasn't (and isn't) always there.

It's said that if you go into the house mysterious people run out, weird noises our heard like footsteps, doors slamming, windows breaking. - November 2003 Update: The house was built in the 40's. The whole area around it was a ranch, and that's where the family lived. The murders happened in the 60's or early 70's. There are two stories; the first being the family had a retarded son they kept in the cellar, but not abusively. He lived down there, had everything he need, bathroom, bed, television. There is a large walk in freezer down there too. Apparently he murdered his parents and kept the bodies in the freezer, and eventually died himself. The second story is that The kid that lived there wasn't retarded, and after his parents died of natural causes lived there. It's said he was a pedophile and a child murderer and would kill children and hide their bodies in the freezer. Right now it's zoned for commercial use, so companies keep buying the property with plans to level it and put a building there. About two or three weeks later, they'll sell it.

Brownsville,United States,"Was known as Ft. Brown during and after the Civil War. It was occupied by both Union and Confederate troops. Soldiers, horses, cavalry officers, etc haunt it. The buildings that house the University are historical monuments. Sightings and sounds have been experienced in almost every building on campus. - December 2004 – additional information - The last battles of the Mexican American war occurred in Brownsville.
