Fort Worth,United States,"Brought from England - Apparitions of a man have been reported. - January 2004 additional information: They say a young man built this castle for his bride to be. The wedding was to be held in the newly finished house, but on the wedding day, the bride was found floating in the lake. No one was sure if she died accidentally or if foul play was involved ...But a few months later the groom married the dead woman's sister. Now, at night, the bride can be seen running from the house, across the road and towards the lake before disappearing. The actual history of the Castle is not quite as dramatic as the ghost stories it has spawned...but in case anyone is curious... The Castle was originally an 1860's rock farmhouse that was purchased in the 1920's by the Whitings. After extensive renovations and the addition of the round crenulated front wing and the rear tower the rambling mansion took on the look of a castle. It was completed in 1938 and Mrs. Whiting, who mostly supervised the renovation, named it ""Inverness"". The residence has seen several owners in the past and at one time Gary Stewart stayed there while filming a movie in the 1950's. In the not so distant past the castle was vacant for a long period of time and was in such disrepair it was on the verge of being condemned.

Knoxville,United States,"Baker Peters Jazz Club is a known haunted site in Knoxville. Now a trendy & expensive Jazz bar, it was once a Civil War era residence. The baseline of the story goes that the house was built by a Dr. James Harvey Baker. Dr. Baker's allegiances in the war are disputed; some have him on the side of the Confederates, others have him as neutral. Either way, he did have at least one son that we know of named Abner who fought staunchly for the Confederates (other versions have Dr. Baker with TWO sons on opposing sides of the war). During an invasion by the Union army in 1864, Dr. Baker was treating wounded Confederates in his home when the Union army arrived and demanded the surrender of the men in the house. Dr. Baker refused and barricaded himself and in his bedroom. The Yankees invaded the house, raced upstairs and shot him through the door. Upon returning home, 22 yr old Abner vowed revenge on the person who informed the Yankees that his father harbored Confederates. He did kill the informer, a postmaster, but was later killed by the informer's friends in a return act of revenge. Legend has it that Abner has refused to leave the house that he and his family fought so hard to retain. The house went through several changes of hands before becoming a jazz bar, which was likely very disrupting to whatever spirits are there. Baker Peters claims to have a framed photo of what looks like Abner's ghostly reflection posted somewhere in the restaurant. Other accounts report employees experiencing chills, hearing whispering, objects moving or being thrown from shelves and breaking, and even (in the early days) discovering a hanging candelabra in a dining room with the candle holders twisted downward.",Baker Peters Jazz Club,Tennessee,TN,-84.0818553,35.9122186,-83.9207392,35.9606384,True,False,1864/03/13,0,Unknown,Ghost (Male),Murder,"3,359",26.3,6.24,15.7%,5.5,7.6,1.7,4.4,56.0%,69.7%,55.3%,44.7%,83.8%,2.95%,88357.0,4.684,6.323,3.04,41947.357142857145,398.2857142857143,239307.0,129.0,8.0,Record Driest,271.0,68.0,38.0,58.0,54.0,32.0,22.0,11.83,Baker_Peters_Jazz_Club_is_a_known_haunted_site_in.png

Manchester,United States,The Tower House as it is known by locals was built by the main financial contributor to the originating fund for and the First President of People's Bank and Trust Co. Around the time that John P. Adams began to build the tower house both his wife May and toddler son Marion passed away. Until 1943 Mr. Adams continued to live in his wonderful house with tower rising over the structure. He owned several lots which extended well toward the town square and a store which is still located at 210 Spring St. on the historic town square. Since 1963 a few brave individuals have admitted to hearing May weep or show fear during a storm. John is often seen strolling through the house from the men's parlor to the front room which houses a Civil War exhibit. Marion is seen upstairs in the boys' room where he and brother John Jr. would watch for kids to come down the way. Marion is seen at times toddling over to the window. He is a blonde haired boy clothed in a wonderful soft light. There are no bad spirits here. May did show great sadness the day a 1870's period garment was place on display in their master bedroom which is now the main lodging room for the current inn. Several media sources have already noted this haunting including radio and newspapers in Tennessee. The inn is owned by GhostLabs Research Society's Dan and Carol Gist.

Nashville,United States,"Belmont Mansion - Adelicia Hayes first marriage, to a wealthy businessman, lasted seven years, in which their four children all died by age eleven. In 1849, her second marriage resulted in the building of the Belmont mansion; it was built in the style of an Italian villa set in elaborate gardens. In fact, Adelicia opened the estate for the citizens of Nashville, as there was no public park available. Her second husband died in the Civil War, and their twin daughters died of scarlet fever. Her third marriage took place at Belmont Mansion. However, she sold Belmont in 1887 to move to Washington D.C. She died in D.C. later that year and was brought back to Nashville to be buried. The Belmont mansion is now the center of Belmont University and of course the mansion has strict security due to random acts of collegiate vandalism. Security guards have reported seeing Adelicia floating around and even setting off the motion detector a time or two. A psychic was secretly brought in once, and she reported that Adelicia was afraid her home wouldn't be there much longer due to the campus renovation and expansion. The psychic also said Adelicia was looking for her children. The psychic didn't know anything about Adelicia's many dead children. - January 2006 Update /Additional information: A 1999 Alumnus reports Adelicia is still around the mansion, but she never does or causes any harm. She has been seen numerous times at different places throughout the mansion and it's grounds. It has also been known and reported that on more than one occasion, she has set off the motion detectors in the middle of the night or other times the buildings are empty, and the security office has to go check things out and re-set the alarms. During any expansions or renovations, the trustees as well as those in charge at Belmont are very careful not to disturb or mess up anything related the Mansion, as it is a historical landmark as well as Adelicia's home.

Bartow,United States,"Construction on the old courthouse was completed in 1909; there is now a newer, much larger courthouse across the street from the older structure, and the old courthouse now houses the Polk County Historial Museum and Genealogical Library. Although the 1909 courthouse was the third building to serve as the courthouse in Polk, it's only the second courthouse to have been built on that particular plot of land (the one before that was built in 1883). The boiler room is located in one of the four basements (it's the basement accessible by elevator only), and many years ago there was an explosion there, killing one male worker; staff, cleaning crews, and visitors have reported hearing screams of pain coming from that basement. The bodies of the Mann brothers, who were lynched by a mob for murdering Marshall Silas Campbell in the street outside the courthouse, were brought and displayed for several days in 1886 in the 1883 courthouse on the second floor the area of the old courthouse corresponds with the second floor rotunda of the 1909 courthouse - there is a feeling of sadness there, and apparitions have been seen on the spot where the bodies were laid out. Also, near the second floor bathrooms and on the third floor, the apparition of The Lady in White has been observed by many people - it isn't known who she is, and she could be one of several women who had strong ties to the building. Strange things have been observed in a room containing ancient Native American artifacts on the first floor, from cold spots to malfunctioning lights. In the actual 1909 courtroom, cold spots are felt and sometimes people feel something ""brushing"" against them - the exact cause isn't known because every trial from 1909 until the new courthouse was completed in 1987 was held there, but it's believed it might be Judge Chillingsworth, who was murdered along with his wife in West Palm Beach and whose gangster killers were tried in that courtroom.",Old Courthouse,Florida,FL,-81.8427846,27.8968167,-81.8431374,27.8964147,True,True,2025/05/13,4,Unknown,Ghost (Male),Murder,"10,655",24.0,6.16,17.5%,5.5,7.3,1.8,4.9,54.0%,69.2%,60.8%,39.2%,85.9%,2.34%,255673.0,15.322,20.685,2.46,116319.28571428572,1011.0714285714286,711119.7142857143,126.0,101.0,Above Average,159.0,50.0,13.0,15.0,32.0,33.0,16.0,11.92,Construction_on_the_old_courthouse_was_completed_i.png

Motorists say this mysterious ball of light appears from out of nowhere and bobs along behind their cars, sometimes hovering over them, but never passing on the road. Reports were so numerous that the Sheriff's Department dispatched scientists to investigate the mysterious luminescence. No explanation could be found. However, locals connect the light to the untimely death of a young man on a motorcycle, decapitated when his bike hit a cable in the road. Supposedly the Greenbriar Light is the solitary beacon of his motorcycle, searching the road endlessly for... its missing parts. - June 2005 Update – The light actually came from the very end of Greenbrier (which at that time was a dirt road) where SR 210 heads directly towards it and then curves away. A witness recently reports they have been out there many years ago and it was a little scary in the middle of the woods on a dirt road seeing what looked like one headlight coming towards you and then one brake light going away.

Spring Hill,United States,"formerly 7-11 - In the early 1980's in the town of Spring Hill which is outside the city of Brooksville there was a 7-11 convenience store which took in most of this towns business. And since it sat along the towns main road it was easy to access Highway 19 to the west about 3 miles away, or the longer haul 7 miles to the east. At one point during the night in the late 80's a drunk male came into the store to buy a case of beer. But the clerk decided out of his own good will to not sell the case feeling the man was drunk enough already and did not want him to drive back to the store later on. The man became angry yelling and cursing so on and so fourth. So instead of buying beer he decided he wanted a pack of cigarette’s. After the purchase the clerk turned his back toward the man to grab some cleaning stuff from under the counter. At this point the man revealed a .357 revolver and shot the clerk in the back of the head killing him instantly. Now the 7-11 has since moved and now it is a Hungry Howies pizzeria, and as the night moves further on more this will happen. The saloon doors to the kitchen will swing open, cups and utensils will fall off the tables and onto the ground. The hanging lights will start swinging back and fourth and the lights and arcade games will suddenly shut off.

St. Augustine,United States,"The Lighthouse - near St. Augustine, many spirits are here; one of a man who hung himself (when, not known), and one unidentified spirit in the basement of the keeper's house. During the 1980's, when the keeper's house was being restored, workers spent the nights in the place to protect it from vandals. They would wake up in the middle of the night to see a small girl in old-fashioned clothes watching them. She would then vanish. The workers would also sense things during their work and would look up to see an apparition of a man hanging from a rafter. The spirit in the cellar has never been seen, but workers at the lighthouse all report an uneasy feeling when they're down there alone, especially at closing time when the place is very quiet. There have also been stories of footsteps on the lighthouse stairs when there's no one around. The guides there are very open about the ghosts. There are many good reasons for the lighthouse and keeper's house to be haunted: the man who hung himself, the little girl who was killed by the train, a light keeper who fell to his death while painting the former lighthouse (very close to the newer one), and 13 executed pirates who were buried behind the lighthouse. Also, there has been some form of a lighthouse on the site since Ponce De Leon in the 1500's.  - Update about the little girl spirit, it is believed that there are 2, They were daughters of the lighthouse keeper and of the foreman when the new lighthouse was being built further up on the island. They used to play on the train-carts that were used to haul supplies from the water to the new location of the lighthouse. According to the local historical society that provides tours of the area, the girls were playing on a cart with the daughter of the foreman. Apparently, the brake was loosened, sending the cart hurtling toward the inlet below. Three of the 4 girls (2 of the keeper's daughters and the foreman's daughter) were not saved in time and drowned when the cart flew into the water. Occasionally, you can hear girls giggling in the vicinity of the lighthouse, and the girl that appeared to the workers was also one of the daughters that is more active than the others.",Anastasia Island,Florida,FL,-81.31243409999999,29.9012437,-81.31243409999999,29.9012437,True,True,2025/03/14,8,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"10,655",24.0,6.16,17.5%,5.5,7.3,1.8,4.9,54.0%,69.2%,60.8%,39.2%,85.9%,2.34%,255673.0,15.322,20.685,2.46,116319.28571428572,1011.0714285714286,711119.7142857143,126.0,101.0,Above Average,159.0,50.0,13.0,15.0,32.0,33.0,16.0,11.92,The_Lighthouse___near_St__Augustine__many_spirits.png

Also, There is a woman dressed in a nightgown that appears usually around 12am at the top of the bridge and hitches a ride with oncoming cars. One semi truck had his story printed in the paper where he said he picked up a young woman, dripping wet and she told him to drop her off on other side of bridge but as soon as he got there, she was gone. There were many sightings of this woman on the bridge who locals believe was a suicide victim, one of many jumpers on the bridge.

As is typical in Florida, a sudden and particularly violent thunderstorm arose to the east of the building, and welled up ominously over the campus. Although the sky directly above the dormitory was blue, a freak lightning bolt snaked across the sky, curling over the building's turrets striking a sunbathing female student, killing her instantly. Since that time, subsequent occupants of the room she occupied have reported mysterious object movements, unexplained sounds in the room at night, and at times an overwhelming sense of another individual present in the room.

If you stay and hang out for a while, like an hour or more, when you come back to your car, there are what appears to be foot and hand prints on your hood and windshield. - June Update/additional Information - it's said that if you turn your engine off on the bridge that it won't start again. You'll have to push the car off the bridge onto the gravel road to get it to start. The poster tried this once and it started right back up. There's another variation to the story, but it's the same thing as what was submitted about Albino Farm Bridge in Springfield, Mo. There's also the ghost of a woman seen walking on the bridge at night. There may not be any truth in these stories about either place. Of all the people talked to about these places over the years, no one ever says that they themselves have seen anything.

He had several wives and several children, but most of them died mysteriously. Mr. Slagle is said to have murdered them all, but since there was no law in Livingston County yet, he was never officially charged. He was also responsible for the first reported murder in Livingston County. The body of the man he murdered is buried beneath the road that runs past the cemetery. The graves of his wives and children are still there along with his own, and the cemetery is said to be haunted. There is also a very old bridge on the property which is said to be haunted. One of the wives supposedly hung herself from the bridge after the mysterious death of one of her children. There are satanic symbols painted on the bridge, and it is very spooky. There have been several people who have been mysteriously pushed off the bridge and injured when no one was standing around. It used to be a place where teenagers hung out at night, but too many people have been injured and it is now off limits.

They immediately ran out and later played the tape, only to discover there were at least 2 ghosts up there. One was a very friendly gentleman's voice and the other a very rude and violent girl's voice that named herself as ""Stacy."" Since then the elevators haven't worked, they have tried again and again, but if you live on the fourth floor you can hear the furniture moving among other noises, which can't be explained. Though the fire did not kill anyone there was a suicide that occurred some 20 years ago by a girl who had been raped on the fifth floor.

Creve Coeur,United States,"Creve Coeur is French for ""broken heart"". In the late 1800's a beautiful daughter of an Indian chief married a strong warrior. They were madly in love but the warrior, like many of the Indian men did, had to go off in hunting parties. These hunting parties would go on for at least 6 months. When the party finally came back her husband did not come back, he had died along the way home. She, who was heartbroken, went to the top of the cliff that is right at the entrance of the park, and jumped off into the water bellow. Now the water falling from the cliff is only in little drops, like tears. At night, and on a quiet day, you can hear a woman cry, and several other people, presumed to be the crying of the loved ones she left behind. Only on full moons, whether you're standing at the bottom of the cliff, or on the lake looking on from a boat, you can see a woman at the top of the cliff looking down crying, she never seems to realize other people are around her. Often she jumps off, freighting the onlookers who think a mortal has just jumped. When people see this the go to the cliff to try and help the mysterious lady, but when the get there no one is there. Recently while 3 men were hiking at night, they claimed to see a woman walking in front of the crying. When one of the men, who was of Indian descent, went to approach her she hugged him, and started speaking to him in her native tongue. Since he could not understand her he just shook his head. She ran off crying when he did not converse with her. The 3 men, now intrigued, followed her, while she ran to the cliff and jumped off. The three men were terrified, not because she jumped but because she disappeared in mid-air.",Creve Coeur Park,Missouri,MO,-90.4854635,38.7262223,-90.422618,38.6608855,True,True,0145/02/13,0,Night,Unknown (Male),Suicide,"2,877",27.1,6.02,18.9%,5.5,7.7,1.8,4.8,50.4%,70.5%,52.5%,47.5%,80.2%,3.72%,77921.0,4.604,6.215,2.47,29032.92857142857,376.7857142857143,213429.0,125.0,96.0,Near Average,608.0,172.0,49.0,174.0,123.0,75.0,16.0,11.83,Creve_Coeur_is_French_for__broken_heart___In_the_l.png

Dumas,United States,"May 2005 Update: the train wreck that spurned the headless woman story occurred in late summer, or early fall of 1892, with sketchy fatality lists stating approx. 13-27 deaths, many being thrown into the river. Therefore, the wreck occurred near the river overpass nearly 1/2 mile from the tunnel underpass. They believe the woman's head was lost to the river and now she eternally seeks it. She walks in the fall, mostly. When she passes thru you, you will feel like a thousand icicles stabbing thru you. Also, there is a cemetery south of Dumas, mostly Catholic burials, with one being a 104 year old woman from Ireland. A visitor was ""attacked"" by the presence of something malicious there one night and it took a Christian psychic to remove the spirit as it was feeding off their energy. Whatever dwells outside this cemetery is neither human nor animal but something from a dark place. The tunnel underpass itself is benign, only haunted by ignorant teenagers who deface it with their graffiti. There is a small dwelling adjacent to the tunnel where a huge, mean dog lived, now dead. His ghost still roams there. It has orange, glowing eyes. There are also several dead babies buried around the area. A woman kept having miscarriages and her husband buried the corpses all around the area.

Florissant,United States,"A lot of people might not know this, but this elementary school is an eerie place. About sixty years ago, before the school was ever built and before the neighborhood around was constructed, there was a cemetery in the area where the school is now. The state ordered the owners of Leaf Brown Cemetery to dig up the graves so that the bodies could be relocated to another cemetery. Well, the diggers stupidly forgot to remove one of the bodies. The reason they didn't notice it there before, was because the body was buried so deep. Now, the ghost of the dead body haunts the elementary school. Some children have spotted the ghost in some of the bathrooms. It is said that the ghost is a woman in a black dress with long blond wavy hair, and no eyes. She sometimes approaches the children quickly and tries to catch them. Luckily they've managed to get away. They say teachers and other faculty can't see the ghost.

Poplar Bluff,United States,"Once you turn on Wilcox road, after about 1/4 of a mile the road will fork and you need to go left at the fork. The road is curvy and paved, but after a few miles it turns into gravel. Once the road turns to gravel go forward for about another mile till you come to a railroad crossing. Most people do this at midnight, but people have reported seeing spirits as early as 10 pm. The story goes that in the early 1900's a train de-railed killing most of it's passengers. But many odd things turned up once they began to investigate the wreck. A few things were that a woman had been pregnant when she was killed in the wreck and once they found her, the baby was missing out of her womb. Another man had become decapitated during the wreck and the police could never find his head. So once you get to the railroad track you pull onto the tracks and shut off your car. Your windows start to fog up very quickly and you can hear a train whistle in the background, it gets louder...then stops. You will often also see a light when you look down the train tracks. While sitting in the car you will hear something tap on your window and if your brave enough to look outside a woman will be standing there asking you where her baby is. And for the extremely brave, if you decide to get out of you car you will see a decapitated man in the ditch searching for his head, many people have saw this (including myself).",Wilcox Rd.

Raytown,United States,"This road has constant twists and turns throughout it. There are no street lights but woods on both sides lining the edge of the road. It has a age-worn brick wall along the side that looks like a old, overgrown cemetery. A valuable source has said they saw a cemetery on either side of the road the first time they had driven on it. Just as they had went around a curve, they said they had seen a woman in it stretching her arms toward the road-or possibly them and standing still. They described her as wearing a wedding dress and a veil. They were going to return at sunrise to look around (they liked to photograph cemeteries). When they had returned to the location, there was no cemetery, but a house under construction, and a wide open field, and on the other side, some trees on a small cliff. They said that the cemetery couldn't have been their imagination, they weren't even thinking about anything to do with it, or scared for any reason. Another resident described seeing a head with a terrified expression on its face roll out of the woods and under the front of the car, again not finding anything when he went back to find out if his mind was just playing tricks on him. There is a old run down wood bridge about half way down the road, and a series of chevron signs before it. Somebody has spray-painted with red paint a letter on each of these signs. Oddly enough there was a perfect number of signs for them to spell M-U-R-D-E-R D-I-E and the last sign which is directly beside the beginning of the bridge says ""Back & Here"" (whatever that means). You have to slow down for the bridge and go about 5 mph over it because the wood is so warped, and numerous people have said when they do this they notice lots of movement on both sides of the bridge and sounds of something walking (on two legs not 4). All reports have been said to have been during the night and one during the day, and for some reason if you bring up Rickey Road all the locals voices change and they all know of it and have their own stories to tell.

Richland,United States,"In the early 1900's a black man named Joe was accused of raping a young white girl. He protested his innocence saying, ""God would prove I didn't do it"". Legend has it that he survived the electric chair but a group of vigilantes took him to the cave where he was tarred and feathered and then hung with barbed wired in one of the larger back rooms of the cave. Joe had been a fiddle player and each night after supper would sit on his front porch and play the fiddle. Now if you go to the cave just around dark you can hear his fiddle music echoing though out it. -  May 2005 clarification/ correction: This is a historical incident, so there are records that provide the date (1839), the name and age of the girl (Amanda Fulbright, age 10), the name of the man who killed Joe (Thomas Rafferty shot him). Joe's dead body was taken from the Fulbright property in Laclede County, MO, to the cave in Camden County, MO (about 10 miles), a medical doctor dissected the body, boiled the flesh off the bones, and rearticulated the skeleton. The doctor’s motive was knowledge of anatomy. Also, the cave does not have any ""larger back rooms."" The first room goes about 75 feet, then tapers down to a hole only large enough for a modest stream of water. No human could enter the hole. And, of course, there was no electric chair in 1839, and barbed wire wasn't invented until about 1876.","""Joe's Cave""",Missouri,MO,,,-92.4043396,37.8569838,True,False,2005/05/13,0,Night,"Unknown (Male, doctor)",Murder,"2,877",27.1,6.02,18.9%,5.5,7.7,1.8,4.8,50.4%,70.5%,52.5%,47.5%,80.2%,3.72%,77921.0,4.604,6.215,2.47,29032.92857142857,376.7857142857143,213429.0,125.0,96.0,Near Average,608.0,172.0,49.0,174.0,123.0,75.0,16.0,11.83,In_the_early_1900_s_a_black_man_named_Joe_was_accu.png

St. Louis,United States,"parking lot - This site was formerly the Gratiot Street Prison. Here is a bit of history on the place. The building had been McDowell's College, a medical college owned and operated by Joseph Nash McDowell. It was confiscated by the Federal authorities in the spring of 1861. In December 1861 the building was converted into a prison and later renamed. Even early Federal records often call the place ""McDowell's College."" It was right in the midst of some of the wealthiest homes in St. Louis. General Fremont's headquarters in the Brant Mansion were only a block away. Right across the street was the home of the wealthy Harrison family. Attached to Gratiot on the north was the Christian Brothers Academy. Unlike other Civil War prisons, Gratiot was used to hold just about anyone and everyone. Along with Confederate prisoners of war were also held civilians (""citizens""), women, children, confiscated slaves (""contrabands""), spies, saboteurs, political prisoners, guerrillas and bushwhackers, and even Federal soldiers who had committed crimes or had misbehaved. Of Confederate soldiers held at Gratiot, the most likely ones came from battles and states in the Mississippi River region as far south as New Orleans.

Also, objects can appear missing at times, only to reappear somewhere totally different than where they were last placed. The curtains on the stage can be seen moving sometimes, as though someone is walking backstage even when no one is there. And no, it's not the AC or anything because the place doesn't have any. It is quite a scary place to be at night alone, one can't really describe it, but the theater gives off an unsettling feeling, like you are being watched.",Avenue Theatre,Missouri,MO,-91.8526457,36.7300013,-91.8523711,36.7281154,True,True,0200/01/13,1,Night,Other (Male),Mystery,"2,877",27.1,6.02,18.9%,5.5,7.7,1.8,4.8,50.4%,70.5%,52.5%,47.5%,80.2%,3.72%,77921.0,4.604,6.215,2.47,29032.92857142857,376.7857142857143,213429.0,125.0,96.0,Near Average,608.0,172.0,49.0,174.0,123.0,75.0,16.0,11.83,The_old_Avenue_theatre_downtown_has_been_host_to_m.png

Houston,United States,"Asbury Cemetery is located way back on a dirt road, down in a valley between some hills. It's a really pretty place, and I have been to more than one funeral there. But it's also a place where people like to park and stargaze. On several occasions, people have described a low voice talking, or an overwhelming, almost gut-wrenching feeling that something is watching them or something is after them. More than one serious accident has occurred from people driving from it at night as fast as they can. A witness involved in a wreck reports:  ""A group of us were out there just hanging out when everyone in our group, which consisted of about 10 people, all stopped talking in mid-sentence and felt a horrible sense of dread. We ran to our vehicles and everyone flew from there. I'm a biologist with a minor in Physics; I don't believe in ""ghosts"". On top of that, my father is a minister, and I have strong convictions against ghosts. Naturally, I thought it was just a change in the wind, sudden drop in pressure, etc., so I went back one night with a girl I was dating and a friend. We were sitting in the car talking when I felt a horrible feeling that someone was right on me. At the same time the girl I was with began to scream and tell me to get out of here, start the car! We flew out of there at full speed and kept speeding down the narrow two-lane road that led to it. Even though we had left the area and were a half mile away, she continued to look out the back window and say that someone is coming, and our friend was saying ""go, man, go! Don't slow down!"" I felt it too, and turned to look out the back window to see what it was; I lost control on the dirt road and my car went down a steep hill into some trees. We were at the bottom of this hill and all any of us could do was yell excitedly in fear at what might be out there. To this day, neither I nor any of my many friends who used to go out there will even turn down the road that leads to it at night. Not from what I said, but because they were there and I have felt it, too.

The unique thing about Fairfield Hills is that it has an interconnected system of underground tunnels connecting most of the buildings to each other.

Fairfield,United States,"Dolan Hall - Former convent-turned-residence hall for Fairfield U. is said to have the ghosts of former nuns roaming the halls. There is one story (which probably isn't true, but you never know) of a nun who was raped by a priest, got pregnant and hung herself. More recently, a student died in one of the rooms and the room is no longer occupied due to uncontrollable temperature changes. Loud and unexplainable bangs awaken and frighten students between midnight and 4AM in rooms 231, 229, 227, and 225, yet no other rooms in that hallway can hear the noises at all. - November 2003 update/correction: A student that lived in the infamous Dolan 231, reports while they didn't hear any banging, they COULD hear people moving furniture above them.

Milford,United States,"located off of Silver Sands state beach has a long and mysterious history. It was a point of conflict between the English settlers and the Wepaowag Indians, who regarded the island as sacred ground, connected with spirits. Following the defeat of the tribesmen, the Chief put a curse on the island, pronouncing ""Any shelter will crumble to the Earth, and he shall be cursed"" About 25 years after the defeat of the Wepauwags, the notorious pirate Captain Kidd, who knew the islands reputation, is known to have buried part his treasure on the island, and treasure hunters from around the country still look for this stash today. It is told that in 1850 two men found the treasure, only to run away from the island screaming about a ""screeching, flaming skeleton descending from the sky"" They spent the remainder of their lives in an asylum. At the end of the 18th century, a monastery was built on the island. After the monks moved in, dismissing the curse as ""pagan savagery"" and ""Indian folklore"", a series of mysterious deaths, suicides, and bouts of insanity, and subsequent intensifying hauntings forced them to abandon the monastery. The crumbling ruins can still be seen today. In the 1950s and attempt was made to open a seaside restaurant and lodge on the desolate island. A devastating and lethal fire, still to which cause remains unknown, ended whatever building projects scheduled for the Island, and no one has built upon it since. All that is left from this is a tumbling brick wall. Today, reports from hikers abound about seeing glowing specters flitting through the trees, disembodied voices, and phantom monks making processionals through the monastic ruins. One also hears of seeing nighttime Indian festivals and hearing jazz music near the old site of the restaurant. The only access to the Island is a mysterious causeway that only surfaces from the sea at low tide. People, in the summer months, frequent the island for its beach and seclusion, as well preserved trails. The ghosts wont bother you if you respect them.
