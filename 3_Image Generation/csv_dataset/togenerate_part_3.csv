Westchester,United States,"On the border of White Plains, NY and possibly New Castle, NY, there is a road tucked away in the woods. Buckhout road evidently dates way back to the early days of the country, 1600's. the local magistrate or some such, (an influential person in the area nonetheless) by the name of Isaac Buckhout suspected that his wife was cheating on him with a friend of his. He invited the friend and his son over to dinner one night where he proceeded to take a shotgun and kill the two of them as well as his wife. Afterward he walked a good 12-15 miles to Tarrytown and sat in a pub until the police picked him up a few hours later. The jury that tried him deliberated for days over his sentence but as the story goes he was the last man hung in White Plains, NY. Now apparently off the main road there are several side roads wherein if you walk into the woods you will see houses that have been abandoned. Further legend has it that back in the 1600's three women were burned at the stake supposedly for witchcraft where the road now lies. There have been reports of their spirits supposedly roaming the area around the road and rumors tell a story of three X's being painted on the road to mark the spot where the woman died. As legend goes, if you drive over these X's and stop, your car will stall and ""strange things will happen."" Exactly what is not known.

Wild Rose,United States,"It has been told that before the property became a campsite for children and teenagers for summer vacations, the lot was owned by a farmer and his wife. It is known that the farmer went crazy when he found out that the wife was pregnant, so he drowned her in the lake, and the farmer was never seen again. Recently, two counselors from the campsite went to check on a missing camper out in the woods at night, and ran into what was an extremely bright light where they describe that they ""couldn't see a thing."" They said they had no choice, but to turn around because the light was blinding, and as they turned around they saw a woman run away from them. The counselors start running in a different direction...a direction that lead to the only tent on the campsite, but when they started running for the tent, they realized they couldn't find it. So, they both turned around to look and see where exactly they were when they noticed that the tent was in fact right behind them...the weird thing about this is, is that in order to end up in front of the tent, you have to cross a road, which the counselors themselves told me they ""Never, ever crossed."" One counselor said ""We were running and running as fast as we could, and then we found ourselves in front of the tent which is impossible unless you cross the road...which we did not.""

These were never used as rooms, but were originally recreational areas for the women in the dorm. In the early 70's, these rooms were closed (1972, I believe) because they were deemed in disrepair and quite unsafe. For a few years, a hall Halloween Haunted House called ""Augie's Attic"" was held there until a fire started accidentally one year, and the activity was banned. In fact, to say that Lawther is the dorm that is primarily haunted could be entirely incorrect. Next door to Lawther, in fact attached to, is Bartlett Hall.

So they all got out and started to push the car up this hill then a car came around this bend and didn?t see the football players and hit them. All of the players died. People say that if you put your car in neutral between these 2 markers you will go uphill because the football players push you up the hill because they don?t want you to get hit by another car. Another story is that two children who lived in the nearby mansion were playing in the road when they were run over and killed. When your car moves, it is the children pushing it off of them.

Mount Ayr,United States,"Tedrow is a small cemetery in the country. In the daytime, there is a tree that contains an evil face. But at night, the spirits frequently make themselves known. It is not the cemetery but it is the woods that surrounds the cemetery that is haunted. Apparently about fifty to a hundred years ago, a small cult came the cemetery and did ceremonies. Now whenever you drive at night into the cemetery, you may enter but you may not be able to get out. The reason for this is because there is a glowing object in the woods and if this glowing object gets too close to you, you will not be able to start your car. But in order to witness the strange happenings you need to have your car turned off and lights turned off. You can have a flashlight with you but that is it. While you are in complete silence and complete darkness, something might run passed you several times and when you look nothing will be there. Sometimes you might hear moaning in the woods, sometimes you will hear what sounds like somebody pounding a metal sheet against a tree. Sometimes you will see a dark figure staring at you from a tree. And if you are really lucky, you will witness the strangest and scariest experience that you ever had. At times you might wait for a good five or ten minutes and nothing will seem to happen, but when you have given up all hope and decide to leave, all at once there will sound like a herd of elephants are all around you and make the loudest racket. You are guaranteed to jump in your car and take off, but that is just the beginning. If you leave your window open, while your driving, you will hear the object following you until you have reached the end of the pathway leading to the cemetery. Also the weather is completely different there, it could be a hot day and when you reach the cemetery, it will be cold. And it could be the clearest day and when you reach the cemetery it will begin to rain. And there could be no wind at all and when you reach the cemetery there will be ten to twenty mile an hour winds. - Fair WARNING ? As with all other haunted places, you need to get permission before going in to a cemetery late at night. There may be NO TRESPASSING and you could be fined. Be smart and be safe, do it the legal way.",Tedrow,Iowa,IA,-94.1260303,40.6714079,-94.235232,40.7147147,True,True,2025/05/13,0,Night,Ghost (Male),Supernatural,"1,305",23.0,5.31,24.5%,5.8,9.2,1.9,4.3,51.8%,69.4%,67.0%,33.0%,88.0%,2.45%,30070.0,1.934,2.61,2.15,8388.0,47.785714285714285,77862.14285714286,118.0,111.0,Above Average,700.0,304.0,24.0,210.0,23.0,126.0,12.0,11.83,Tedrow_is_a_small_cemetery_in_the_country__In_the.png

Sioux City,United States,"A former worker for 10 years reports: The building was constructed in a period of 10 years during the 1940's the date of completion was possibly 1950. Upon starting the older employees would always talk of ""Rodriguez"". He was one of 2 resident ghosts in the building. There was actually a building electrician that died in the late 50's by the name of Rodriguez. In those days they had to manually lubricate high-powered electrical connections before they would have a show. Rodriguez as the building electrician was responsible for this. One day before a show he turned of the power to the electrical junction so he could perform his duty. He told another employee that he would be done in 10 minutes and that the other employee could then turn the power back one. Well the other employee waited the 10 minutes and turned on the power. 2 hours later Rodriguez wife showed up with a new suit for him because it was his birthday. They searched the building and found him dead by the electrical box electrocuted. He haunts the building to this day with flickering lights and lights turning on when they?re not supposed to as well as just a general coldness in the area of his death. The other ghost is that of a 12-year-old boy. He and his friend in the early 60's climbed up on the roof of the building to hunt pigeons. He became separated from his friend and his friend left thinking he was gone already. The missing child was not found for 2 weeks until a foul smell was detected at the bottom a roof exhaust that was meant for a boiler that was never installed. The total fall was over 150 feet, And the shaft was hastily completed with many sharp edges and exposed rebar jutting into it. It was not a pretty sight. He frequents the roof doors and the bottom of the shaft. When you enter the roof you can hear screams, as you get closer to the area of the fall.

Stratford,United States,"In the middle of three miles of woods, is a cemetery that is over 150 years old. It was once the ancient burial ground of the local Indian tribe. When the settlers came, they dug the Indians' graves and placed them in five mounds throughout the hilltop. In retaliation, the Indians killed a white woman names Mrs. Henry Lott. She was the first white woman killed in Webster County. She was buried there. Over fifty small children are buried there along with many soldiers. If you go there at night, you can hear children laughing and the sound of Indians. If you roll down the hill three times, you will see the stairway to heaven. Also, legend has it if you desecrate and Indian mound, you will be cursed.

Charleston,United States,"On the bank of the Kanawaha River, at the train depot, just at the bottom of the exclusive South Hills mountain drive, the Charleston Train Depot rivals any 19th century European Town Center. At the depot, flanked by the river on one side and a winding suburban mountain road also exists a carriage trail which led, in days gone by, to the Governors Mansion. The depot has a restaurant and a scenic view. The old carriage trail is barely noticeable from the train platform, but driving up the hill on the right side of the forked road motorists can see a clear wide carriage road leading to what is now Sunrise Museum. Vagrants and homeless people are said to spend some nights near the bottom of the trail waiting for a train to hop, and high school students sometimes wander the trail at the top of the trail behind the museum. No one ventures past the desecrated statue of a Our Lady. A dark spot exists in summer and winter at the second curve from the top of the trail (or the third from the bottom).

Parkersburg,United States,"One mile south of Parkersburg, is a small farming community called Marrtown that was settled by Scottish Immigrants in the mid 1800s. They came from an area of Scotland that believed in many supernatural creatures, including witches, ghosts, elves, fairies and not the least of them, the Banshee. The Banshee is an Irish/Scottish death fairy who attaches herself to Scottish and Irish clans. She sometimes rides a white horse and hangs out at waterways washing out the grave clothes of her dead. She is dressed in a death shroud and other tattered rag and her eyes are blood red from crying for her Scottish dead. Thomas and Mary Marr survived the Civil War, but they lost a lot of property. Thomas went to work on the toll bridge in Parkersburg that went over the little Kanawha River. He would always see a figure on a white horse whenever he came home very early in the morning. On February 5th, 1873, Mary awakened with a feeling of dread. She got up and look out the window and saw someone very old riding a white horse who was coming up to her front stoop. She went outside and saw it was an old woman whose eyes had an eerie glow. Finally, the old woman screamed, ""Mary Marr, Thomas Marr has just died. Say your prayers, Lady. I bid you will."" Woman and horse instantly disappeared. Within the hour, a man who worked with Thomas came to deliver the dreaded news. In fact, Thomas Marr did die -- he died in the icy waters of the little Kanawha River. Some say it was an assailants bullet that brought him down, Others say it was the keening cry of his Scottish Banshee that wailed and startled him into falling and meeting his death in the river below. Many still claim the Scottish Banshee still rides her horse on clear night and she still brings death to those of Irish or Scottish blood. Even to this day, the Marr family is still visited by the Banshee's presence. It would be wise to stay away from Marrtown on cold, lonely, moonless nights.",Marrtown,West Virginia,WV,-81.5852649,39.2546161,-81.56151349999999,39.2667418,True,True,1873/01/01,1,Morning,Ghost (Male),Accident,"1,037",27.3,7.24,13.9%,6.4,9.8,1.8,5.1,39.1%,70.8%,49.8%,50.2%,84.0%,2.03%,28285.0,1.335,1.802,2.97,5208.642857142857,69.07142857142857,43340.78571428572,129.0,92.0,Below Average,,,,,,,,11.83,One_mile_south_of_Parkersburg__is_a_small_farming.png

Truth or Consequences,United States,"Ask any hospital employee that has worked at Sierra Vista Hospital for any length of time, especially if they worked a night shift and they will tell you about a paranormal experience they have had . This is an old hospital built in the early 1950`s and as a result tends to have a lot of sightings. Nurses will tell you that they will hear the sound of a baby crying a day before a baby will be delivered. There have been numerous times night shift staff will see ghosts out of the corner of their eye only to disappear when they turn to get a better look. Beds have raised and lowered by themselves without anyone at the helm operating the bed. Linen closet doors would open on their own as one would pass by. When the hospital first opened nuns operated it and would cook brownies for the patients.

Curlew,United States,"Curlew/Cascade Job corps. - a former student of Curlew Job corps has heard many of the same stories; how ever, they are set there on the Curlew campus. The tunnel story for the Curlew campus is very likely true, for that campus was a S.A.C. radar compound before the corps took it over. The Dish is still up on top of the hill lovingly referred to as ""Radar hill"". Cascade however, has always been a Job corps campus. Curlew is definitely haunted. Colville Native American Elders believe that the site where the Curlew campus is in the heart of sacred land. Normally sacred land reacts badly to being tampered with, but the Job corps is a place where children go to heal troubled hearts, pasts, and souls. This campus has a 98% success rate because the spirits there are helping where the staff cannot. - July 2005 Update/ Correction - Cascade Job Corps is housed in what was originally Northern State Hospital for the Insane. The Hospital opened for business in 1912 and remained an insane asylum until I believe right around 1970. Locally it is referred to simply as Northern State Mental Hospital.

Duvall / Maltby,United States,"It is hidden off to the right hand side of the Redmond Duval Road. (20 miles East of Seattle.) It has about 35 grave sights and strange, unexplained things happen there. People have seen women and children, dressed in old, raggedy looking close, wondering around the gravesites. Witnesses have also felt physical things like being hit.February 2005 additional information: There used to be a staircase that began at ground level and descended 13 steps below ground. I believe the legend/story was that it was a below-grade entrance to the opulent tomb of a locally wealthy family. In any case, kids used to get drunk near or in the cemetery and would walk down these steps late at night. It is unsure whether there were doors or simply a dirt wall at the bottom of these steps. Regardless, once you reached the bottom of the stairs and turned around you supposedly no longer saw the cemetery but a vision of Hell. The similarity in this story to yours is that this vision drove the subject to insanity. Anyone watching the subject walk down the stairs witnessed them stop, turn, and fall dumbfounded to their knees. I’ve heard that several children emerged nearly comatose from the steps – many of them never uttered another word. the story goes that these steps were bulldozed over (depending on the age of the storyteller, the bulldozing occurred anywhere from 1992 to the early 1960’s) and that the severe NO TRESPASSING limitations were a result of that.

On a separate occasion a cloud of ectoplasm was seen to float across the top view of the camera in the basement, followed by a thunking noise off to the right off camera (the direction the ectoplasm was headed). A final odd incident, a guest's young daughter had the knack of tricking the elevator in to taking her down there -despite the supposed lock on the elevator to prevent such things- and was seen on one occasion holding a conversation with someone who could not be seen, but was heard as a mumbling male voice. Upon inspection by the front desk, there was no one down in the basement, but they experienced an uneasy feeling while retrieving the girl. The hotel has changed ownership twice since being built, so the identity of the gentleman in the basement is unknown. He was not an employee of the current owners.

Tacoma,United States,"The Pagoda - The Pagoda used to be the trolley terminus at Point Defiance in the early part of the 20th century.

Sighing can be heard at other times and there are cold spots in the storage area below the building. A tale has been told about a young newlywed couple during the 1920's. The husband and wife would catch the trolley to Point Defiance and the husband would see his wife off for the day to visit her parents on Vashon Island. Small groups of boats would shuttle people to the island for a fee. The husband would return in the evening to meet his wife. As the small launch she was riding in approached the Boathouse area, it took on water. Many people were thrown overboard in the confusion and the husband observed with his pocket spyglass his wife flailing in the water in her heavy period clothes as she went under.

Woodinville,United States,"This beautiful winery is set up on 150 acres previously owned by Seattle lumber and dairy baron Fredrick Stimson. Although the winery itself was constructed in the mid-1970s, Mr. Stimson's old (early 1900s) mansion still occupies the land (manor house). Legend has it that Mr. Stimson had a love affair with one of his servants (supposedly named Elizabeth) and got her pregnant. When Mrs. Stimson found out about this, the servant had an ""accident"" and fell down a back stairwell, which leads to the kitchen. Kept in its original state, the house is still used constantly for meetings and dinners. Staff at the winery for years has had paranormal experiences here. There have been many reports of cold spots that follow you, strange shadows, and noises. Elizabeth seems to be particular to one of the upstairs restrooms by opening the window, closing the door, and turning the light on. Late night cleaning staff has reported hearing footsteps upstairs when no one is there. Other occurrences include lights turning on, toilets flushing by themselves, and security systems going on the fritz.

Chesterton,United States,"Around 1915, the area that is now the Dunes State Park in northern Indiana was mostly uninhabited wilderness. The stories spread around the vicinity of Chesterton, Indiana that fishermen who were along the beach at certain times of the day had been lucky enough to catch a glimpse of a naked woman swimming in the lake. The story spread that a beautiful woman was living as a hermit along the beach and her notoriety grew to a point that many compared her to the ancient Greek goddess Diana...hence the name of this legendary creature. In truth, her name was Alice Marble Gray and she was the daughter of an influential couple from Chicago. Alice had traveled extensively and was cultured and educated. She had worked in the city as an editorial secretary for a popular magazine, so what had made her take up the lonely life of a recluse. Some have claimed that Alice came to the dunes because of a broken love affair but actually she left the city life because her deteriorating eyesight had made her work impossible. She had sought refuge in the rough land that she had enjoyed as a child. Alice moved into an abandoned fisherman's cottage on the beach and lived a life of peace, borrowing books from the library, walking in the woods and of course, swimming naked in the chilly waters of Lake Michigan. In 1920, Alice met a drifter named Paul Wilson and he moved into the cabin with her. He was an unemployed boat builder with a shaky past but he seemed to make Alice happy and the two of them stayed together until 1922.... when tragedy struck. The badly burned and beaten body of a man was found on the beach and police suspected that Wilson had a hand in the murder. He was questioned but eventually let go. He and Alice moved to nearby Michigan City, Indiana, where they made a small living selling handmade furniture. Alice bore her husband two daughters but he treated her terribly, often beating her severely. In 1925, Alice died in her home, shortly after the birth of her second daughter. The official cause of death was said to be uremia poisoning...complicated by repeated blows to her back and stomach. Wilson disappeared and later tuned up in a California prison, serving time for auto theft. The fate of Alice's daughters is unknown. Legends of the dunes say that Alice still returns to the beach and the wilderness that she loved so much.

Over the next 10 years the farmers all were killed by an axe. One report said that a gypsy returned from the dead and haunted the woods, which is where the farmers bodies were found.

Fort Wayne,United States,"There is a bridge near the hollow. There have been many stories like a headless horseman, boyfriend and girlfriend died when a motorcycle goes over the bridge, hangins, but here is the real story of it. a woman lived in a house up on a hill by herself. This old woman would speak to a friend about how there was kids that would break stuff on her property, sneek up to the windows and look in, and overall harass her. They would tell people she was a witch. One night in early 80's these teens set her house on fire and wouldnt let her out of it. The building stood for a while but now all that stands is the chimney. people who go there for a ""spook show"" are run off by the ghost of this woman because she feels like they are no better than the teens that killed her. There was no new house built on her hill.

The Cemetery was mostly children but the ages were between stillborn and 10 with some adult graves. The best-known grave that is still intact was from an old man that worked at the Elgin Watch factory in the early 1900s.

The Local School District U46 that owns the school had in the past removed only a few graves(Just enough to build a basement) and left everything else. In the 1990s they dug up a total of 8 skeletons in the area where they were going to expand the building. They also at the same time finally removed stones from the hill, though it is unlikely that they bodies were moved with as no digging took place for that assignment but there is fresh sod on the hill. Another fact is that the majority of the graves were not children but adults. One of the few remaining graves being of a man that was older but worked at the Elgin Watch Factory in the Early years of the town. There is another fact.

Elgin,United States,"Once known as the Old Elgin High School, the building was erected in the late 1800s. After a fire broke out in the first 50 years the school moved down the road and the District boarded the place up.

Elgin,United States,"The school was about 100 years old. People have said that they hear little children crying or laughing by the k.g. area. Down in the basement people said that they hear noise of someone hamming some type of metal. Teachers seem to stick together when going to their class room. During night time people have said that weird things happen in the building. Few years back the school had a vote to build a new school or to remodel the old building, students and staff voted for a new school. The school no longer stands and place where it once stood is now a parking lot for the new school. - August, 2005 Update: This is a popular Urban Legend Hoax. This school was originally built in the 1940s therefore it is not anywhere near 100 years old. The old building was torn down due to asbestos and a need for a larger building, as the place was tiny but built in a way that they could not expand upon. They rebuilt it so that it was on a different part of the hill that it was on and now more capable of expansion. This was done back in 2000. The building was recently closed after being open for one year due to the fact the district did not have the funding to keep it open as the Person who was superintendent for the last several Years a Dr. Marvin Edwards retired shortly after playing with the accountants books and it was determined that when he left he took several million dollars with him. Thus the district has had to close down many of its schools to save money. Among the schools were Illinois park and Grant Elementary which was one of the oldest elementary schools in the area being that it was Grant that was the 100-year-old school. Thus the whole thing about Illinois park is not fact.- January 2006 Update: Illinois park just so happens to have been built in 1930s. The original building was torn down as they needed to fit more students in the building than there was room for. The newer building was built in 1999. This building is abandoned at the moment due to lack of funding by school District U46 to keep it open. basement in the old building was a large open area used only as storage. The only people that could go back and forth in the basement were the janitors. Though the building is abandoned it is on land owned by the district and the Elgin Police department is constantly on the premises. It is recommended that unless you want to be confronted by a cop that you stay away from the place.WARNING:If there is anyone that is planning on doing anything in any of those locations they must be sure that they have permission first else they will be arrested.",Illinois Park School,Illinois,IL,-88.310645,42.049882,-88.2825668,42.0354084,True,True,0100/03/13,0,Night,"Other (Male, student)",Violence,"5,151",26.2,5.17,20.5%,5.7,9.1,1.9,4.4,52.0%,70.6%,57.4%,42.6%,82.0%,3.48%,134820.0,9.716,13.116,2.51,64291.92857142857,796.0714285714286,368952.9285714286,127.0,121.0,Above Average,122.0,52.0,25.0,13.0,5.0,15.0,13.0,11.83,The_school_was_about_100_years_old__People_have_sa.png

Elmhurst,United States,"At one time it was also called Spaso Speakeasy, originally it was a lovely stone manor. Directions to follow the story, It is said that long ago the woman that owned it hung herself in the attic/which has been converted to the office/storage space for whatever business inhabits the building. The small basement has been used as a liquor/storage room. The building has several dining areas with fireplaces in each one that have been converted to gas. Employees of then Spaso Speakeasy were almost asphyxiated by gas fumes when setting up before opening one day, everybody began to get sick, it was later discovered that the gas for the fireplaces had been turned on but not lit. For years employees have complained that the pull chain light switch at the top of the basement stairs, gets pulled and the light goes out, forcing you to either try maneuvering the stairs in the dark or leave the lower light on, if you walk up the stairs and turn it on and go back down to finish what you are doing, the light chain gets pulled, and the light goes out. There are secret panels and rooms behind the walls, that very few people are aware of, their purpose is unknown at this time. One in particular is between the front entranceway and the kitchen, along the wall to the left. The bar area is particularly active, and things disappear and reappear, such as a corkscrew that disappeared. After exhaustive searching, the manager went out and purchased another one, a few hours later, the missing corkscrew was simply sitting out in plain sight on the bar, in the open. The ghost has been called Mrs. Murphy, although, it is not known if that was/is the true name, and is more like a trickster than a specter. Just an odd note, a Halloween party was held in the year 1989, (then Spaso Speakeasy) a raffle was given for door prizes and the first ticket drawn was *0666, No one held that ticket and it was not in sequence with the role of tickets being used. Most/all businesses in this building have failed, it is/was near the corner of North Avenue and Route 83, If you start out at the intersection of North and York, travel toward Route 83, it is on the right side, one business from the corner, a Peppers Waterbed Store used to be the business just past it. It is within visual distance of the Golden Pheasant restaurant, which is across 83, and on the left. -  December 2005 correction/Update: The Stone Cottage Pizza building in Elmhurst is still there. It had been converted to a relatively popular bar and grill. That business, on westbound North Ave. has failed. There is a sign on it saying, ""scheduled for commercial redevelopment"". Parking availability cannot be blamed for it's closing. The Golden Pheasant restaurant mentioned in the same spot on the eastbound side of North Ave. still flourishes with the same amount of space. North Ave and Route 83, is reported to be the busiest intersection in the state. - March 2007 Update: It is being torn down with two next door establishments and will probably be use for mini-strip mall or something like that. - October 2007 Update: It has been demolished.",The old Stone Cottage Pizzeria,Illinois,IL,,,-87.9403418,41.8994744,False,False,1989/03/13,6,Night,Ghost (Male),Accident,"5,151",26.2,5.17,20.5%,5.7,9.1,1.9,4.4,52.0%,70.6%,57.4%,42.6%,82.0%,3.48%,134820.0,9.716,13.116,2.51,64291.92857142857,796.0714285714286,368952.9285714286,127.0,121.0,Above Average,122.0,52.0,25.0,13.0,5.0,15.0,13.0,11.83,At_one_time_it_was_also_called_Spaso_Speakeasy__or.png

Slavery was Illegal in IL, so the owner has a side entrance built on to the house that a wagon could pull up to and a person or persons could be taken into the house and up to attic without being seen. Some of his victims were free blacks that he kidnapped and held captured until they were sold down south when was done breading them. To this day the attic still has the little stalls with the chains on the wall and floor. You can hear the moaning and crying of the slaves. Some reported seeing Big Jim in the Attic and other places in the house. There is a lot of activity in the house. The owners would give tours and even let people spend the nightin the attic.

Evergreen Park,United States,"St. Mary's Cemetery, The boundaries of this cemetery are, The B & O railroad tracks which cross 87th St. on the east side, Pulaski Rd. on the west, 87th St. on the north, and 91st St. on the south. Unlike Evergreen Cemetery to the east, St. Mary's has a fence going completely around it, with the main gate on 87th St. and a smaller gate on 91st St. located between Homan and Trumbull Avenues. Late night drivers on 91st St. have reported seeing someone leaning against a fence post along the fence bordering the railroad tracks, with his arms folding across his chest. One driver reported that the figure seemed to react to his driving by, by placing his hands on his knees and crouching down, as if to look at him from under the branches of the tree between them, after which the figure disappeared. That St. Mary's has not had more reports is somewhat surprising, as several deaths, all violent, have happened in and around the cemetery over the years. The first death was in 1927 at a restaurant/speakeasy located along the tracks, at that time many funerals came to the cemetery by train, where the party would have the funeral, then have the after funeral lunch at the restaurant while waiting for the return train. During Prohibition, this restaurant( known as ""Vinegar Hill"") was used as a speakeasy after dark, in 1927 one of the Westside O'Bannion Brothers was murdered there, by the Capone Mob. The next death happened in 1933, on the tracks, about 30 yards south of 91st. At this spot occurred the last daylight Train Robbery in the U.S. Two men stopped the train at this point and stole $50,000. from the mail car. One of the robbers was killed during the robbery and never identified, the other robber was never caught, and the money never recovered. Finally, in the 1990's two men where shot once each in the heart, around 2:00a.m. While ""visiting"" the grave of a rival street gang member, on the anniversary of his death, this murder is unsolved.

Indianapolis,United States,"haunted by the young wife of the first owner. When you go by the house at night you can see blue lights flickering on and off on the grounds and in the tower window. According to legend the man couldn't stand the thought of burying his lovely young wife so had a special glass coffin built and placed in the tower. He would go visit his wife every night. The tower was lit by soft blue lights, her favorite color. - June 2008 Correction / Additional information: It was located on Fall Creek Road and is now Skiles Test Park. The house was abandoned and torn down in the 1980's. It also says that the owner had placed his deceased wife into a glass coffin and displayed her in a tower. This part of the story is also incorrect. The story goes that Mr. Skiles Test, after the unexpected death of his wife, had her placed in a glass coffin and displayed in a large bay window of his home surrounded by blue lights. Now that Mr. Test has passed away and the house has been torn down, at night you can still see the glow of the blue lights. The story of the house of blue lights is not true but it is a story that I would like to pass down to my children. The reason that Mr. Tests home was called the house of blue lights is because he loved the color so much that he kept his Christmas lights up on his house and around his pool year round. Mr. Test was a very wealthy business man that was committed to his community and even donated a parcel of his land to the Lawrence Township School Board. The school board graciously accepted the land and built an elementary school on it named after Mr. Test.

Kendallville,United States,"The Strand is said to be haunted by one of it's previous owners. There have been multiple sightings of the man. First there was a woman cleaning the theater one day with her 3 and 5 year old children running around. As she was cleaning one of the theater's she heared her children screaming. She went to see what was going on and they both told her that there was a man at the top of the stairs (the stairs that led to the balcony). The woman called one of the workers in and he asked the kids what the man looked like. They gave him a very elaborate description. A few days later that same worker was closing up after the shows and was making sure the emergency exits were closed. As he walked out of the hallway to the one exit he looked up to the projection room and saw a man duck his head really quickly. The man fit the same description the 3 and 5 year old children gave just days before. He ran immediately upstairs; the only way to get to the projection room and there was noone to be found. About a week later a man came along and bought The Strand and the worker noticed this man looked very familiar. He talked to the man and found out that the man's father used to own The Strand as well and killed himself in the projection room years before.

Joliet,United States,"The Frank Shaver Allen house haunting was well-documented in the local press in the late 1970's after a team of psychics and a Joliet newspaperwoman investigated it. The family then living there cooperated in the investigation after having experienced very dramatic paranormal events for over a decade. The house was built for wealthy Frank Shaver Allen in the latter half of the 19th century. He is believed to be one of the lingering spirits there. Also, reported are an elderly woman, believed to be someone who died from a terminal illness in the house; a former nanny and her charge, a young boy; and other spirits not identified. Many, many sightings of spirits and other strange events have occurred at the residence and have been witnessed by occupants, visitors, the psychics and reporter and others such as gas meter readers, etc. A boy who lived there experienced repeated visits from the ghostly nanny and boy who repeatedly invited him to join the ghost boy forever as his playmate. Unexplained, illusory fires have been seen there. A renovation/redecoration of the house inspired a wave of supernatural occurrences.

More history to this road is during heavy mafia activity in Chicago around the 1930's they would dump bodies off this road because it was, at the time, out of the way and seldom traveled. Most of the bodies were not discovered until the mid sixties when the area started to be developed. Through the late 1980's until the mid 1990's the woods around this road became a popular place to commit suicide. Most people that have killed themselves there were area high school students. There are a few houses still on the road, near the main development. Many reports of various apparitions (figures in the woods, ghostly lights, voices, being chased by cars/ creatures). also, mostly due to the fact that it is surrounded by woods, various animal parts are frequently found along the road. these are odd in the fact that they seem to almost always be placed in the exact center of the road. Never an entire animal like road kill, but parts...a head, a leg, a torso.

Monmouth,United States,This is one of the oldest cemeteries in Warren County. Most of the stones date back to the early 1800's. There is an Indian buried there who was killed by the people trying to settle in the area. Story has it that this Indian was responsible for scalping a white farmer who was working in his field. The community hunted down the Indian a killed him. There has been documented investigations in this cemetery several times in just the past few years. Many uncertain images appear in pictures and audio recordings playback what sounds to be Indian chanting. The area residents discourage anyone from entering the cemetery after dark. This stems from several problems with cult activity in the years past. Many have stated that even on the hottest summer day once you enter the cast iron gates of the cemetery a cool breeze will follow you around.

Ottawa,United States,"Located in Spring Falls off of route 6. The story goes: There was an old biker bar on route 6 in the 1980's and a man and his wife were drunk but decided to go home. He also decided to take the short cut, a small road with deep ditches on each side, not many people took this road back then because of it's size. Anyways there was a curve in the road and the man was going really fast and slung shot him and his wife into the ditch, on impact the wife died and the man was paralyzed from the waist down and was bleeding everywhere, knowing no one could see him in the ditch he went up onto the road and wrote HELP in big letters across the road in his blood. He then went back down to his wife and died later around 3:00. Around 9:00 in the morning a farmer was going down the same road, because this was his normal route and he known the road well. Saw the help on the road and thought that it was some teenagers playing a trick, then seeing the man and woman next to the motorcycle wreck drove to town to the sheriff’s office and told him of what he saw. After the sheriff and his team took the motorcycle and bodies out of the ditch and to the town they had to wash off the HELP in blood with chemicals so no one would become freaked out. the next morning the farmer was going down the road again and saw the HELP as clear as day and was appalled that they didn't wash it off. he went to the sheriff and told him to clean it. Confused the sheriff sent the team out again to clean it, this time the farmer watched, the next morning the farmer again went down the road and saw the HELP spooked, and knowing that it had in fact been cleaned he told the sheriff and they thought that it must have been some kids. So the night-shift sheriff went on his routes throughout the town and also took help road to see if he could catch the kids playing the trick. He went down to the spot around 2:00 am and there weren't any words or people around. Around 3:05 he came back the there were the words HELP in blood. In the same exact writing as it had been the first day. Since then help road has been widen a little and paved over and every time the words HELP appear in the same spot in the same exact way.

Palatine,United States,"Shopping Center - Right on the northeast corner of this intersection, in front of the shopping center, once stood the old Browns Chicken & Pasta restaurant, site of the infamous Brown's Chicken Massacre of 1993. On a cold January morning in 1993, police found seven murdered people stuffed in freezers in the back room of the restaurant, apparently victims of a robbery. The building had stood empty until the following year, and then it became a dry cleaning establishment. It was then when some people experienced very violent, and angry vibes that were not their own, and some had felt sudden decreases in temperature, even during the height of the summer. Nearby residents even claimed they had heard the sounds of faint shots and screaming during the evening hours, often repeated time after time. The cleaning establishment finally went out of business in 1999, and the building was torn down the following year. The oddities still continued. In May of 2002, the two killers were finally apprehended after nine years of little or no leads or progress in the case.

On one occasion the basement of a house on Jamestowne Rd was said to be haunted with the dead twin of the only girl that was in the family. She can be seen during the night, standing behind the furniture or in the back corners. On another occasion in a house by Sleepy Hollow Elementary there has been reported a sighting of a man dressed in a black suit, a little boy with brown hair and a green sweater, and handprints that would never go away no matter how many times you went over them with paint, in the basement. These handprints are pushed out from the cement in a relief. They look like something is in the wall that wants to get out. Footsteps have been repeatedly heard in the hallways.- January 2006 Update: The second areas described can be reached from the corner of Mclean and Thorobred lane. It should be noted that the entire village area is under neighborhood watch and the cops there love to pull people over and issue fines, also due to the forest area surrounding it is best not to spend time there unless you know the area as the deer really do love to walk in front of moving vehicles.

Wayne,United States,"basically the story about these tracks is that a mother was driving a car over the tracks with a car filled with children. The car stalled just as she got onto the tracks.

Watseka,United States,"Supposedly, there is a mansion in Watseka that is haunted by demon. The story goes, that in 1812(early 1800's), there was a 12-year-old girl who had moved in with her family.

Their daughter became possessed as well. - February 2004 update: There is actually a book called ""Watseka"" that details this. Asa B. Roff's daughter had spirits come through her and was thought to be insane. They bled her regularly trying to treat her (getting rid of the ""bad blood"").

Woodstock,United States,"A ghost sits in same seat in balcony and is never occupied. it is always left empty for the ghost during any performance. The ghost is seen walking halls and in the upper windows periodically looking out. She has been seen by the living. Known as Elvira, people have described her as being a beautiful entity, ""whose blond hair hung below her slim waist,"" and who was wearing a ""filmy, dancing gown."" When young actresses are in the theater to try out for a part in a production, the staircase is watched diligently, because sometimes, on occasion, a young actress has the irresistible urge to travel up the staircase to the open portals, probably under the influence of Elvira. So far, all such actresses, in this hypnotic state, have been pulled away from danger. Elvira likes to move props, and untie scenery flats so they fall over, to let the living know that she is there, and needs some laughs as well. Seat DD113 is Elvira's favorite seat in the audience seating area. All the seats are spring-loaded; meaning that they stay in the upright, folded position, unless someone is sitting in them. Actors, actresses and stagehands have often seen seat 113 in the down position, as if some unseen presence was sitting in it, watching the rehearsal. After examining the seat 113, it is always found to be working properly, staying in the upright position. Whenever a performer misses a cue, or bungles a line, a low, deep sigh is often heard, coming from seat 113. Elvira expects high standards to be maintained by the cast of any production. In the 1940's, while Shelly Berman was working on some scenery for an upcoming production, late one evening, he heard a noise from the audience seating, which made him look in that direction.

Wells County/Warren,United States,"Thirteen Graves - January 2006 Correction – This was posted twice under Wells County and Warren. - on State Road 3 off of Willow road is the old Batson cemetery, no one has been buried there since like the late 1960s , there is thirteen unmarked graves. As you count them there is thirteen and supposedly if you turn to count them backwards one grave vanishes. No one knows who is buried there. Some believe it is remnants of an old limestone walkway, The walkway can be proven with pictures at Huntington library taken of the cemetery in the early 1930's. Also it has a glowing grave, at night when you drive by you can see one particular grave glowing at night. Some people have also witnessed an old ragged looking man who is supposed to be the caretaker of the cemetery. He is believed to be the caretaker of a blind school not some 100 ft from the cemetery that was tore down in past years do to deterioration. He would supposedly watch over the cemetery at night after the children were asleep. UPDATE: The cemetery is under surveillance due to numerous complaints of vandalism and destruction, you will be escorted off the property and possibly arrested. NO TRESPASSING December 2003 addition - They say when there is a full moon, you will see a boy with a hatchet that will chase you down the road. They also say that if you throw a rock at a certain grave a girl (one of the thirteen dead), will come out to talk to that person and only that person. About one mile back in the woods near the cemetery is the site of an old house. The old house is where a family of 13 people died from a extremely deadly disease. When the bodies were buried, there were too many of the bodies for a proper grave. The bodies were buried and cement pored over the bodies so the disease couldn't escape. There is a light that hovers above one of the graves, and it is only visible when all lights are off. One resident has noticed that every time a person walks into the cemetery, a tree nearby will make a squeaking sound.

West Pittson,United States,"The claimed incidents began in 1974 and lasted until 1989 in the home of Jack and Janet Smurl. Whether the haunting was genuine or an elaborate hoax is debated. According to the Smurls, the first signs of paranormal activity began in 1974. They reported that a television set burst into flames, and a stain appeared on a carpet overnight. Water pipes began to leak even though they were repeatedly re-soldered by a plumber, and scratches resembling those from a large cat appeared on paintwork and bathroom fittings. Toilets flushed without human intervention, footsteps were heard on the stairs, chest drawers opened and closed unaided, radios worked when they were not plugged in, rocking chairs rocked while empty, and a sour smell filled the house. In 1985, John and Mary claimed to hear loud, obscene language, and Jack and Janet's house became often extremely cold. Two days after this, an icy cold swept the house and a strange black human shape allegedly materialized in the kitchen in front of Janet. It was about five feet nine inches tall, and with no facial features. It later appeared to Mary Smurl in her kitchen.

Anywhere from swash buckling pirates burring stolen gold; A ghost ship hovering over the woods; British soldiers hiding colonial treasure during the revolutionary war; A full Spanish galleon which vanishes in thin air; Skeletons in knight’s armor wielding threatening swords; Mysterious groups of shovelers digging furiously late at night; to ghost horses and cows appearing and disappearing before your eyes. All of these and more have been seen at different times of the year. There has also been a rumor going around of a witch that lets off a green light flying through the trees. -  February 2004 addition: 4 Eye-witnesses have vowed never to return to this area of land. The woods got their name from an old house that was in the center of them. The story behind the house is unknow at this time. The house caught on fire and then put its self out. Then a few years later it caught fire again and burned to the foundation. There is one spirit that comes up out of the water and walks along the beach towards the road.

The Spanish Galleon that comes in from the water hovering over the beach and then above the woods. If you are on the beach and face the woods you can see the grove in the tree line as to where the ship docks. You can watch the ship hover there above the trees and watch as figures of men get off the ship. The whole wooded area lights up and you can hear digging and clanking of shovels.. There are 2 black headless dogs that will come out of the woods and chase you. As well as jump onto your vehicle or in the bed of your truck. The green light is truly astonishing. It is more like a ball of light. That is so intense it lights up everything it flashes 3 times for brief periods of time. but doesn't distort your night vision when it passes.. Usually when you see that light it is time to go. You have worn out your welcome on the beach. If you remain things will start to attack your vehicle.
