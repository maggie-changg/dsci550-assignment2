San Francisco,United States,"Located on Sacramento St. in Chinatown, San Francisco. Once owned by Lady Cameron, the basement of the house was a refuge for Chinese immigrant from lives of prostitution and slavery, among the obvious discrimination and hell that was once Chinatown. She sealed the doors in the basement to protect the immigrants from inspections by the police. If she can't open the doors, they can't inspect and then arrest and possibly kill the rooms of people. However, the people were able to come in and out through a secret passageway. Apparently, rumors spread about her philanthropy and some people came and burned down the house. Everyone in the rooms died. Now, the restored Cameron House (turned church) sends chills up spines. The basement doors are still sealed, but every door contains a red charm and a gold charm to seal in the spirits, as well. Furthermore, the pipes that run along the ceiling run to the end of the hall forming an ""X"" over a door with the script: ""do not enter.""

San Gabriel,United States,"The San Gabriel Civic Auditorium s past is very long and there are many stories of hauntings. Back was being built underground tunnels were built under the length of the building. They were built so that the owner (nicknamed Uncle John) could go from backstage to the foyer. When Uncle John died the tunnels went unused for years and when the depression came those tunnels were used as catacombs to house dead bodies. Once they were filled the catacombs were sealed. In the men s restroom in the front there is a door. When you open that door there is just a brick wall. When a crew tried to breach the wall they got five feet and there was still brick. Why would some one seal a tunnel in more than five feet of brick? No one will ever know unless the try to breach it again. Now to the stories. There is a drop that was preserved because it was the only remaining drop from the original stage. Some times during the Temple City High School musical that drop swings unintentionally. There is no wind and no one ever touched that drop. A psychic was brought in and they said they saw a man swing on the drop. Another story is that there are TV monitors on stage left that broadcast what is being shown on stage. In 2003 and there during the Music Man there was a person seen in the second story window on one of the houses. Many stage crew, tech crew, and actors saw this man on the TV monitor. Also many of the audience saw this man too. The problem with this is that there is no way for a man to be standing in the second story window because there is no ledge or anything for him to stand on. The man was later recognized as Uncle John. There are also stories of a little girl who roams the halls and a old stage manager who roams the halls at night.",San Gabriel Civic Auditorium,California,CA,-118.1084277,34.0983284,-118.1058333,34.09611110000001,False,True,2025/01/01,1,Night,"Ghost (Male, actor)",Death,"15,443",24.4,5.04,16.6%,5.5,7.7,1.6,3.7,40.0%,69.1%,64.4%,35.6%,86.1%,2.49%,376899.0,35.011,47.264,3.29,181495.2857142857,2121.0714285714284,1091981.142857143,118.0,103.0,Above Average,338.0,87.0,51.0,105.0,57.0,30.0,9.0

Fact is no one has ever died in that theatre. No Janitors are ever allowed to go up there nor do they have reason too. The history however, behind George is he has been ever present since the has been built. No one really knows where he comes from or what the history of the land is or anything...though there is a basic story that does float around. So far our George has three figures...The first being there was the business like man figure that was standing up against the wall. The second time George appeared, it was to the actors - [techs never saw him that night] however actors kept complaining about a little boy running around backstage trying to catch his toy ball. The last sighting that has happened was about a year ago witnessed by 2 people who where alone in the building. It was of a very large man and he sat down and filled up the aisle of the house ...which is about 2 and 1/2 to 3 feet wide. A week later after seeing this one of the witnesses was in the lighting booth. and reports, ”My friend and I were coming down the stairs of the lighting booth to go talk to our teacher, who was at the other end of the building...no where near the stage or house [where the audience sits], as we got half way down the whole booth started shaking violently. Us thinking it was an earthquake ran and got the heck out of there. We went to our teachers office, which is located in the same building, and asked her if she felt an earthquake or anything.

Klamath Falls,United States,"The old college on old fort road is a very strange place. No one knows exactly why it closed. Apparently, there is a group of Satanists who work up there. It is believed that when people do sacrifices or something, bad energy is contained in the area. Anyway, several people have gone up the hill and have told me that there is a spot that has a bunch of rocks placed in a circle in the center is a pile of animal bones, but when the people went back up to find that place again, its always gone, and they will go up several times in search of it. Anyway old OIT had a dorm two school buildings and a gym that had a small swimming pool. There is one wall left, and a small area that has three walls and a cement floor. They are maybe 50 feet apart. Anyway, several people, credible witnesses say that they have seen apparitions, sometimes a fog in those two areas. Also if you go at night, you can hear sounds like people chanting, or footsteps if you sit in car with the lights off right next to those two buildings. Also just up the road from old OIT there is a hill, or at least what appears to be one. It’s a small vortex. One of the urban legends is that an old Indian was hung from a tree on that hill right next to the road. If you park under the tree, he will push you up the hill. But there are so many of those stories in various states that it is doubtful. - April 2007 Update - It's fenced in.

Coloma,United States,"In Coloma, CA, there is a famous Victorian house called the Vineyard House, which has been reputed to be haunted by its original owners for many years. The house was built some time in the late 1800s, and was used over the years as a jail, an inn and restaurant, and, as its name implies, a winery. It was also at one time supposedly the site of where some executions took place. According to records, the original owners who built the house suffered one tragedy after another. Several of their young children died, their winery was eventually ruined because of a blight, and the husband contracted syphilis, which over time caused blindness and mental illness. Because he became violent from being mentally ill, his wife had him chained to a wall in the basement of the house, where he reportedly died. The entire family is buried directly across the street in a graveyard that overlooks the house. Reports of seeing ghosts in the graveyard have also come forth in the past, but most of the stories took place inside the house. Ghost stories of the encounters where told by employees and guests of Vineyard House. One intriguing story was told by a couple who were staying in one of the upstairs bedrooms. It was late at night and all was quiet, when suddenly the couple was awakened by the sound of drunken men coming into the hallway downstairs. They were very loud and were singing and laughing and making a general raucous, so the husband upstairs stuck his head out the bedroom door to tell the loud men to quiet down. But upon doing so, he saw three men dressed in Victorian clothing ascending the stairs, and then they faded right before his eyes. Another story from a different couple who decided to stay at the inn was that something frightened them so badly that they packed up and left in the middle of the night. They reportedly refused to say what had happened that scared them so badly. The basement was used as a bar, and it was late at night after closing hours. The owner was cleaning up and wiping down he bar. He said that there was one last glass at the far end of the bar, and as he was cleaning, the glass suddenly began to shake, and then it slid all the way across until it finally stopped right in front of him. He admitted that he had no rational explanation for what he'd seen. It is believed that the things that go on in the bar are the original owner who died down there while chained to a wall. Other things that have been reported are sounds of rustling skirts, and there is apparently an area near the kitchen that is constantly cold. A woman having dinner in the restaurant claimed that she was approached by a young child who asked her to mash his peas and carrots for him. Another scary incident occurred in the restaurant when a large chandelier suddenly came crashing down, barely missing some of the guests. It used to be that when the restaurant and inn were still in operation, you could pick up a pamphlet that gave information about the hauntings. It was a famous place because it had been there since the Gold Rush, and there were pictures of famous people, such as John Wayne and Dudley Moore, hanging on the walls. The hauntings were so well-known that the house was featured on That's Incredible! and Ripley's Believe It Or Not. Sadly, the house has been closed to the public for quite a few years. If you are ever visiting old Coloma, the site of the famous Gold Rush, be sure to drive by the old Vineyard House, and know that you are seeing a house that has been famous for its hauntings for many years.",The Vineyard House,California,CA,-120.8993991,38.8082798,-120.8902916,38.7999214,True,True,2025/01/01,4,Night,Ghost (Male),Murder,"15,443",24.4,5.04,16.6%,5.5,7.7,1.6,3.7,40.0%,69.1%,64.4%,35.6%,86.1%,2.49%,376899.0,35.011,47.264,3.29,181495.2857142857,2121.0714285714284,1091981.142857143,118.0,103.0,Above Average,338.0,87.0,51.0,105.0,57.0,30.0,9.0

Corona,United States,"February 2004 Update: formerly listed as El Cerrito - Live Oak Inn - As the story goes, back in 1988, a young waitress named Michelle was strangled to death and left in the trunk of an old car behind the back patio of the inn. Rumor has it that although the dishwasher is still doing time for her murder, it was actually the cook that committed the crime. Regardless of who killed Michelle and why, she still haunts Live Oak. The new owner doesn't mind and comments that, ""People say she is a really nice girl and even shy."" He has never seen her, but has had many complaints from customers that she continually flushes toilets close to closing time. Perhaps even more spine tingling than Michelle's story is the fact that in the Inn's earlier days, people were often hung from the twisted oak tree in front. If you look closely, you can see the tree growing arou nd an old noose!!!- February 2004 additional info – a bartender / waitress reports she is a witness to the rumors of Michelle the ghost, and of the old owner ""Larry"" who shot himself in the office. She has worked there for almost a year and Michelle has stopped flushing the toilet and started ringing the food bell constantly during all hours. She has seen shadows of her out of the corner of her eye when she is there alone. one of the cooks son's talks to the ghost but it is supposed to be a secret and he can't tell us who he is talking to. he also sees a man in black who walks around. the noose is visible in the tree and she says she has touched it to see what it was made of. it was almost rope like wire and it is grown into the tree.",J J Live Oak Steakhouse,California,CA,-117.5042616,33.8048627,-117.5664384,33.8752935,False,True,2004/02/13,4,Unknown,Ghost (Male),Murder,"15,443",24.4,5.04,16.6%,5.5,7.7,1.6,3.7,40.0%,69.1%,64.4%,35.6%,86.1%,2.49%,376899.0,35.011,47.264,3.29,181495.2857142857,2121.0714285714284,1091981.142857143,118.0,103.0,Above Average,338.0,87.0,51.0,105.0,57.0,30.0,9.0
Corona,United States,"There are many stories, one night in the kitchen area a few of the workers were doing side work and a few others were in the bar after closing and a big metal pie cutter flew off a shelf onto the counter on the opposite side of the room a few feet away. There were now many witnesses who believed that strange things were occurring at our store. Servers reported trays flying at their heads in the dishwasher's area and salt and peppershakers once empty were full. The spookiest always happened to the vendors who cleaned the restaurant. The carpets would be cleaned on a monthly basis and they would always come in pairs. Something would always happen, strange sounds, floating balloons, TV's being turned on, etc. All of these things could be explained by scientific methods: electric currents and helium filled balloons losing air. Whatever was going on in that building after the emplo yees left was bad enough that the carpet cleaners would never come alone. On the occasions that they would come alone, they would come right at closing and be done before we would finish closing the store. On one occasion a lone carpet cleaner decided he would do it by himself after the employees left the building, saying that all the stories were hogwash. The next morning the opening manager found him in his truck in the parking lot with all of his carpet cleaning materials left inside of the building. He refused to step foot into the restaurant and complete the job. He wanted to get his equipment and get out. Seems while he was in the building the entities played with him more than they played with any one else.

La Puente,United States,"workers claim to see little kids running around the theater and then they suddenly vanish into thin air. - Update & a little background info: The Puente Hills Mall AMC theater was attached to the mall until 1996 The Broadway Department Store was known by employees to be very haunted. On the third floor, stock workers were frightened by music coming from a locked and empty stockroom, and the area of the freight elevator was quite simply a terrifying place for me to work in. Workers had feelings of panic and chills. On the second floor, employees heard their names called by someone unseen (this was a very common occurrence, experienced even by non-believers), clothing would swing on racks as though someone were walking between the racks, cool breezes and the sound of breathing were felt and heard in the stockrooms of the Children 's Department, and several times before the store opened employees heard the sounds of someone straightening the racks in the Lingerie department, and see two legs wearing black pants standing behind a tall fixture (on which were hung bathrobes, etc.), but the sounds and legs disappeared when they went to see who was working. All of this occurred both before, during, and after store hours. Also, in the second floor freight area, they would see people passing the door of the room in which they were working, but no one was present when they checked the hallway. This, too, was a common activity. The first floor had similar activities, but employees working after hours in the freight dock would see what we thought were customers passing the windows of the dock doors, but when investigated, the store was empty. One dock guy quit after he experienced this a couple of times. The store was closed and torn down in 1996, and the theater was built. Reportedly only one person ever died on the store property: a manager had a heart attack while at work, and died while they were loading her into the ambulance. A child was severely injured once while playing on the escalator from the second to the first floor, and his blood stains had soaked into the tile at the foot of the escalator and remained until the store was destroyed.",Puente Hills Mall AMC,California,CA,-117.9315794,33.9925902,-117.9495083,34.0200114,True,True,1996/03/13,16,Unknown,Ghost (Male),Death,"15,443",24.4,5.04,16.6%,5.5,7.7,1.6,3.7,40.0%,69.1%,64.4%,35.6%,86.1%,2.49%,376899.0,35.011,47.264,3.29,181495.2857142857,2121.0714285714284,1091981.142857143,118.0,103.0,Above Average,338.0,87.0,51.0,105.0,57.0,30.0,9.0

Los Angeles,United States,"Westminster Ave. Apartment Bldg. - Charlie Chaplin used to own several of the large buildings that sit near or along the famous Venice Beach Boardwalk in Los Angeles. In the day, these buildings were commonly used as bath houses or lodging for wealthy vacationers. Today, these buildings have been converted to apartment buildings for the local artists, musicians, and other creative types that now inhabit Venice Beach. Incidentally these buildings cradle around the famous Building Number 26 on Westminster Ave. It has been documented in print as well as Chaplin's films that during the early 1900's he did much of his filming in and around these properties on Westminster Avenue. In 1915, during the filming of ""By the Sea"" Chaplin's stunt double mysteriously disappeared from the film set. Production was put on hold for three days and a full on man-hunt was instated. After tur ning up empty-handed, it was assumed that the long time friend of Chaplin's must have quit and left on his on recognizance. The studios that were financially backing the film, were losing money. Under haste, Chaplin was forced to replace his stunt double and continue production of the film. On the seventh day after the disappearance, Chaplin returned to his dressing room after a day of shooting. His dressing room was located in the basement of the now famous Building number 26 on Westminster. It is documented that Chaplin, while accompanied by an entourage, entered the room to discover his stunt double and long time friend lying dead on the floor, wet and covered in seaweed. The man appeared to have been deceased for several days. How he had ended up on the floor of Chaplin's dressing room after missing for almost an entire week, is still to this day a complete mystery. The ""now"" inhabitants of the famous building claim to still hear strange noises emanating from th e walls of somebody walking through shallow water. Other noises include moaning, and sounds of someone distantly crying for help. In addition to the assortment of disturbing sounds, there have been several sightings of what appears to be an apparition of a man bound by the hands and feet standing in luminous corners of the large building. Quite possibly the most blood curdling detail of all these sightings is what the man is seen wearing. He's dressed the same way he was the day he disappeared.

Sitka,United States,"A woman was struck and killed on the blind corner outside this well known watering hole in southeast Alaska.

She tried to wander into town on her own, which was a common thing in this small town. Often, a cab could be flagged or someone who knew you would pick you up along the way. She staggered onto the road on the blind corner, and was literally run over by a young man who had been drinking as well, and driving a truck. She was so drunk that she actually got up, despite the terrible, traumatic wounds that she had received. She weaved about screaming and dying, not fully aware of what had happened to her. There were several witnesses to this tragedy since the bar was closing. Hundreds of people were aroun d, climbing into their vehicles and gathering for an, ""after hours"" party. It was a horrific scene. Since then, there have been stories of an apparition of the woman seen on that blind corner weaving in and out of the road. She supposedly has appeared to people who are driving under the influence of alcohol, prompting even brave men to park on the side of the road and flag a cab.

Adamsville,United States,"The community of Indian Meadows and its sister community Shady Grove, are both built over an ancient Cherokee Indian burial ground.

People have reported hearing scratching noises outside their houses late at night. One man heard scratching sounds on his front porch late at night, and each time he turned on the porch light to investigate, nothing was there. But the next morning he found claw marks down the banister of the porch. Some see the shadows of people (possibly the spirits of the restless Indians) rushing past their windows at night, but investig ate to find no one outside. In several homes, people have reported hearing footsteps late at night in hallways or on stairs, doors slamming shut by themselves, voices calling out their names, electrical equipment going on and off by itself, and even the sound of someone or something running through the house.

Anniston,United States,"The legend of Anniston High School's locker room is known widely throughout the school. The legend is told to all the new coming female freshmen that go to their lockers to change clothes for P.E. They are told by the upper classmen to give the freshmen a little scare by warning them of a vengeful ghost. The legend varies in detail from person to person but the main facts of the story are almost always the same… A girl is late getting changed and leaves a precious item behind. She decides to go back to get it while sending her friend to hold the bus for her. A man then tries to rape and kill her in the locker room but he ends up dead and the body never gets recovered. The obvious conclusion is never go into the girl's locker room by yourself. Always go in with one of your friends and never leave anyone alone in there. The true incident that started this legend occurred in 2001. This is what happened: There was this girl (name is unknown) who always changed for P.E. She was usually the first to change for P.E. and also the first to leave P.E. and change back. One day while coming in from playing outside, she was late in changing. It was the last period of the day and she was hurrying so that she wouldn't miss her bus. Her best friend was also late and they only had two minutes to change, instead of their normal five minutes. While they were hurrying to change, other girls who had already changed left to wait in the gym for the bell that signaled the end of the day to ring. Her friend was faster at putting on her school clothes but her friend stayed to wait with her in the locker room. They rode the same bus home, so they both knew that it was almost always one of the first buses to be there and didn't want to get left behind. So the girl finally finished putting on her clothes and they both walked out to sit with the rest of the students in the gym to wait for the bell. As the bell rang, the girl just remembered that she left her purse in her locker. She was concerned about leaving it because it contained all of her money. The girl's best friend offered to go back with her to get it, but the girl insisted that her friend should get on the bus and tell the bus driver to hold it for her until she got on. So the girl ran down the steps and entered the locker room to get her purse and her friend ran out to get on the bus. The friend relayed the message to the bus driver. As the girl got her purse and began to close her locker, she heard the door creak and thought someone had come in. Thinking it was her coach, she called her name and yelled, ""Coach! Coach! It's me, I left my purse. Please don't lock the door just yet."" She got no answer. She then heard footsteps that seemed to draw closer to her. She then began to grow scared. Suddenly, she heard breathing that was so loud she was sure the person w as right behind her. She panicked and dropped her purse. She ran the other way around the lockers toward the doors, but was yanked to the back of the lockers as she turned the corner. She kicked and screamed as the hands of a big strong man tore off her shirt and began to rip off the rest of her clothes. He began to strangle her and scream at her to shut up. She continued to fight back and tried to scream, but her throat closed and she couldn't scream anymore. She still didn't give up. In her last attempt, she pulled down a set of lockers on top of him. He laid there motionless and breathless... he was dead. In a fright, she ran out of the locker rooms to the bus stop. But she had taken too long and despite her friend’s desperate attempt to hold the bus, she had been left alone. She was still frightened by what had happened and called her mom to come and get her. After telling the shocking story to her mother with great trouble of reliving the incident, they called the polic e. But when they inspected the scene, they only found the pulled down lockers, the girl's purse and a pool of blood. The body was nowhere to be found. The girl was more shocked then ever. She was sure the man was dead and the amount of blood on the floor indicated that it was impossible for him to still be alive. Her fear was just too great to go back to where she had been raped and strangled, so they moved and were never heard from again. The man was never found, but many say that his ghost still lurks in the locker rooms waiting for an unsuspecting girl that's by herself to take his revenge. Many didn't take this seriously until a similar incident occurred when a girl in the band who was to play at a football game was left by herself to get dressed. The band left her in the locker room and played all night without noticing she was gone. After the game had ended, she was sitting in the parking lot crying. She wouldn't say what had happened, but appeared to have been strangl ed and her clothes were ripped and covered in blood. She then moved away without telling anyone of her dreadful story. Many girls have been known to hear footsteps drawing closer when no one's there, lockers close and shut, and the door creaks open as if to let in an unwanted stranger when no one is there.
