Mr. Forepaugh was into the dry good's business, so when his fortune was made, he bought this beautiful mansion. He also decided to hire himself some servants to accompany his new found wealth. Well, Mr. Forepaugh became rather fond of one of his servants in particular. Her name was Molly, and the two of them soon began to have a steamy love affair together. However, things got rather ugly after Mrs. Forepaugh caught the two together in the midst of their lovemaking. She insisted Mr. Forepaugh break off the affair, and so he did.

Georgetown,United States,"Formerly listed in Murrells Inlet – Old Gunn Church/Graveyard -  An old church built as a parish in the 1700's. Now burned down but front of church still remains.

The Old Gunn church (accurate name is Prince Frederick's Church) ruins are not in Murrells Inlet, SC but is located on highway SC22-4 off US 701 about 16 miles north of Georgetown, SC. The book ""Ghosts of Georgetown"" gives a good accounting of the events of this church and its history but there are variations of the story. One version: During the building of the church Mr. Gunn (who was either an architect or Overseer of the slaves) was in the bell tower. It is believed he was an Overseer because when he fell he was not dead and the slaves refused to approach or help him. They feared him so much for his evil ways they ran away and left him to die alone, cursing them. The church was finally finished but had a tragic history and was finally abandoned. They say he haunts the area. Witnesses report the air is very heavy and thick though the ruins are in the open with pine trees around the area.

Summerville,United States,"The Story goes that a woman had a husband that was a conductor for a railroad company in Summerville...and he worked nights. At midnight every night, people could always see her there, waiting by the tracks with his lunch and a lantern...waiting for him to stop to eat. One night, he never showed. She was told that the train had derailed or crashed, and he was beheaded and, of course, killed. Although they buried his remains, she would never accept the fact that he was gone, and so, she went to the tracks at midnight with her lantern and walked up and down, waiting for him. People of course began to think she was crazy, but she continued this nightly ritual until her own death. Mysteriously, the light never stopped coming. This is what my mother told me happens at her visit to THE SUMMERVILLE LIGHT: When you go to the tracks, just before midnight, you can hear all the sounds that are usually heard at night, crickets chirping, frogs croaking...the breeze blowing.... but for some odd reason, and this has been the case for every person who has seen THE LIGHT...at midnight, the sounds suddenly just cease. As if a presence has quieted them momentarily. Then you can see it, usually its far off, a light and nothing else...coming your way. If you stick around, THE LIGHT will chase you. Scared visitors tried to jump in their car and leave and the light came upon them swiftly, and they heard a BUMP on their car, as they sped away. When at a safe distance from the sighting, they got out and looked, and there was a dent on the car, where the lantern hit it.

Poncha Springs,United States,"Along the old ""Chile Line"" abandoned Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, above Mears Junction (about 2 miles up to the south), used to be a water tank where trains would stop to replenish water for their boilers so they could make it over Poncha Pass. The story goes that one time in the fall of 1894, when the train stopped, a small child named Annabell got off the train to walk in the woods awhile with her brother. When the train started up she was no where to be found. Her parents and brother got off the train to look for the girl. They stayed for days, and even with the help of the County Sheriff and local ranchers on horseback, she was never found. On several occasions during the autumn while the train was still running, engineers and conductors have thought that they saw a small child playing in the woods.

Many adults and scouts have reported on various occasions hearing moaning and low muttering sounds coming directly from the dugout late at night. The story is that De Anza buried some gold at this site on his way down into Poncha Springs in the 1600's. An old miner found the stash of Spanish gold pieces while mining in the area. They found him dead, locked and sealed up in his little dugout, supposedly scared to death, with no mark on him!

Poncha Springs,United States,"A civil war haunting is present just off the highway on the north side of the pass on a big curve, where according to Union Army records, a small contingent of troops encountered a renegade bunch of Southern soldiers running from a posse of mounted volunteers. It seems they had been sent by the South to intercept a gold shipment and take it back to Texas. They were successful in stealing the gold shipment on a wagon and had almost crossed Poncha Pass when they ran into a Union patrol form Ft Garland. A small skirmish ensued where three rebels were killed and most of the gold was retaken. Two soldiers that were wounded carried off one of the four wooden crates of gold and ran to the south up little Pemmican Creek where they disappeared for all time. Some say they left the area, and some have said they died in the dense woods and aspen groves from their wounds. The Union patrol searched for many days but could not find any trace of them. The three Southern soldiers who had been killed are buried in the Poncha Springs Little Round Top Cemetery. Local ranchers and miners have reported seeing a old man in tattered grey uniform feebly asking for help, but when they would go to help him, they could never find him. Motorists along this stretch of Hwy 285 have seen a older man in tattered clothes saluting as they passed. The sheriff was called on several occasions to investigate, but no one was ever found.

Thornton,United States,"Riverdale Road is a circuitous and meandering stretch of poorly maintained country road running primarily from northeast Denver then north to Highway 7 in Brighton. The road is within a distinctly rural area currently and derives its name from its parallel relationship to the South Platte River. Between the road and the west riverbank is a dense alluvial soil which is rich and fertile which attributes a long history to the road. The area was not farmed in the traditional sense until the late 1880's and there was never any official form of slavery on any of these farms, yet there is a definite sense of the arcane and tragic. Unlike the officially platted roads of the Colorado highway system, Riverdale is very curvy and follows the bank of the South Platte, belying its original usage as a section of the so-called Trapper, or Cherokee Trail, used by the indigenous inhabitants of the area for nearly 1500 years before contact with the Europeans in 1817. Little is known about the place during this time. What is well documented is the time period from 1880-1950's when the area was part of the large truck farm complex, primarily of Sugar Beets. The harvesting of the Beets would occur during the fall and was done by abjectly poor eastern European immigrants who worked the Smelters the remainder of the year. As a result the farms were notorious for their abuses of the migrant workers to the point of near slavery, a tragedy which continues today. This, along with the many pioneers and such who died traveling Cherokee trail has riddled it with angry and unpleasant spirit activity. In addition to the aforementioned legend there is a place, some miles south of Highway seven and near to the northernmost end of the road which is distinctly hilly, uncommonly so. The hills are some 300' in height and uniform in shape. These hills surround a large building and a residence known to local teenagers as the ""gates of hell"". The legend which surrounds this place is that some time in the early 1980's a bizarre and abusive religious cult was cloistered there where they would commit unknown heresies, including the death of a child. To this day it is said, that at certain times, a number of phantom dogs can be seen guarding the driveway and have even gone so far as to chase some people into their cars, a point at which, they disappear without a trace.",Riverdale Road,Colorado,CO,-104.9045666,39.9091581,-104.9719243,39.8680412,False,True,2025/03/07,6,Unknown,Ghost (Male),Accident,"2,623",27.2,5.82,19.8%,5.6,7.6,1.6,3.7,45.4%,67.7%,61.3%,38.7%,83.1%,2.78%,71300.0,5.057,6.826,2.89,16726.785714285714,164.78571428571428,154630.14285714287,93.0,92.0,Below Average,1270.0,687.0,84.0,232.0,168.0,68.0,30.0,11.75,Riverdale_Road_is_a_circuitous_and_meandering_stre.png
