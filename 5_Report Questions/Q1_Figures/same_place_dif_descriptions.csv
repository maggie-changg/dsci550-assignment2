Not moving farther away, just around, sometimes back to where you were just standing. Just walking by the field would make your hair stand on end. The land was developed within the past couple of years. A subdivision now stands on this land. But, the field was on the south side of Thirteen Mile Rd., between Meadowbrook Rd., and Decker.
